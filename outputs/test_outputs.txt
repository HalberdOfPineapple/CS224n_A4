You know what I do is write for the kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for the kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or <unk> and never one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about a little bit of circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell in some place.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare in class.
When I went back to bleed every week in the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom room of teachers.
I did it to secret, it.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the night I got a phone call from that <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never get to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> pancreatic cancer, and I'd like to get you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about was present in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I've been talking about this today.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water -- almost 60 meters. And I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers -- or they break the booms of ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and they hold up to the end, whereas others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separate and themselves, in large as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> is melts in a <unk> I am breathing into its <unk> atmosphere.
As an iceberg is melts sweet freshwater in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's kind of frequent to actually see a <unk> <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and the line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved toward the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an hyacinth <unk>
You pull out of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single child, OK.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to go too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined to the X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined to the X <unk> <unk>
Both of them, and it begins life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity in my ground on the ground on the ground to be two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> training and what I study in this case is the way people are tackling the anatomy -- that of human bodies -- of human bodies -- how they have considered body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that works in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> <unk>
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins <unk> two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical boards doesn't fit into male and conventional feminine organizations.
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of forms.
I'm going to put in some examples of ways of having sex that don't fit into the common forms of either male or female.
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which gene <unk> the chromosome and says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that we have in <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, body doesn't react to it.
It's the Yentl syndrome?
So there's high testosterone levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a result, the body is developing following a course of typically a woman.
When you go back, the baby has a little bit of a girl.
It's a little girl. He's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, but until puberty, when you're growing up and developing the breast, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like this.
Women like men, we have in the body of something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman, not knowing its <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with the <unk> calls <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing, which is not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as <unk> and sexual relations with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and I had just discovered that I had <unk> and <unk>
It had a extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus of the areolar glands, they were so active that they were essentially creating a male hormonal environment.
As a consequence, its genitals were exposed to the hormone component that typically male <unk>
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk>
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th century develop what's known as <unk> to say, they have tissue <unk> wrapped up in <unk>
We don't know how much that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies -- are <unk> twins <unk> or <unk> <unk> to surgery -- it's not to be able to have better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why you get to various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is having a <unk> identity <unk> being black means to have African anatomy in terms of historical terms.
An <unk> simplistic idea.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic.
Imagine how surprising it is to have children who are born like two people inside one body.
The highest recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> was put in the fabric of his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called them to ask, "What would you do to do if you <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no one test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> we are us who we map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, we need to admit that these categories of categories -- we thought of these kinds of categories -- and we thought of these were <unk> forms that are <unk> directly with <unk> <unk> -- they are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What is the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go back into science and more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories of <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, it's the struggles of beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to <unk> with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him would put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved still yet.
If I stopped moving through it.
But we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of determining the death of somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories, we don't have the past.
And maybe you think that this explosion of categories might be celebrating someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it gets to me.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking about <unk>
It would be from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a fervent fan of parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so valuable, in what they did, that I find myself every lot of seeing that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with parents <unk>
<unk> <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you all remember, what we <unk> our parents <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The <unk> monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was going to be the political power on the right of the grandfather that was passed from the father's right to the father and then the son, etc.
The parents had been rejected by the idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered to was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And in part of it they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
And it was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And so there is really clear if you look at the history of parents -- I think many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed through a vague idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And indeed, a result, they were broadcasting the idea of coincidence <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened?
And women <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the middle of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people in color who are <unk> the coincidence of the <unk> the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we had to take it to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the <unk> children were supposed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things, at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary. <unk> three months before I was time -- June 1, June 1, before.
Henry, the other thing was born in term, was born on March March March <unk>
For the only fact that we had been born three months before Mary is attribute all the rights three months before the Henry -- the right -- the right to the heart of sexual consent, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, Henry, for virtue of being considered <unk> if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man right now is <unk> from the mandatory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary. <unk> it doesn't have the same rights to marriage as Henry in every states, for example.
Henry can marry every state with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> <unk> categories that in many ways, are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science will be <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided to get married with a man -- you don't have to get a chromosome out and get married with a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make any test tests of people.
But this is also very strange to the story that I told you about the beginning of the Yentl syndrome to the <unk>
If you look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I <unk> <unk> a solution.
It says that we should judge people who are not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks like <unk>
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this for human rights to people, because I have to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve the social services that some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can be able to make more intelligent and intelligent decisions about their sex relationships than people from 40 to <unk>
So, how do you put the subject of <unk> content.
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue to lead this current thinking relative to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed unless he's willing to have a change of sex in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had made <unk> twins and then pick them up, and then they <unk> her name.
But when the phone asked him the question was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country, these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
So what I said, "Well, has considered the political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people who are the ones who are <unk> to change for the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, to finish I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what the democracy, or as it might be, if we had given greater involvement to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, which is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about them.
For years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things I've been interested in are the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was at the graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in Feminism <unk> I thought I was <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> What about women's <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I ever heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing women in the <unk>
But the more I think about his question, more it has seemed to me that there is something of women's <unk>
I mean, there could be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more responsive to the complex and willing to willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the parents were very hard to find the way to protect people by the state, is possible to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> <unk>
And maybe that is what we need to do in the future when we get away from democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So while we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinking about where they want to go live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't count on a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth more than their building cost.
So we could easily be able to <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound ridiculous if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just took over the apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments were already owners and the other half will still lack to do it.
You could try to increase the capacity by doing expansion of all the existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that these buildings and the areas that surround them have the norms to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to an entirely new place, building a whole new apartment building completely again, and when the norms of that <unk> <unk> the construction instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments -- new reform zones of reform big enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following elections -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of standards, as those rules that say you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They were called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a hotel room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which, in some cases, is worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion -- and at some point, when there was a pause, which said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk was describing in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it begins with <unk> terrain a <unk> which is <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> to me called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to go to <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which included an image like this, which is to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that will measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained to you that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice for a city that could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of kilometers away to the North.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the government leaders of the government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them establish and make the norms of <unk> so that they could all be trusted.
We went and saw a site.
This photo is there.
It could make a few thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that could create these special <unk>
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the parties, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
<unk> in the Constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed another time on the other voting <unk>
Immediately after the voting on the age of 21, in the 21st of February, an <unk> <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in Korea in the <unk> it's bigger than the Boston center.
All you see there was built in four years after four years after four years after the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, it's a practical point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> and the <unk> to operate under a external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be <unk> for this new <unk> system.
There are urban builders and cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people that say they would immediately move to another place.
There's a million a year a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go to get a job -- sometimes these are single mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What do you seem to think about insist for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you, TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a confession public -- and that's I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find himself, and more recently, photograph and publish my blog and <unk> colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it becomes my personal quest for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I would like color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was talking about for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings you to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven <unk> <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after I get here to Palm <unk>
And because you don't know me like the woman who walks for TED in underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call it brilliant tiger ...
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see a phenomenal amount of 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> it cost me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I have used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just show you, you will love you.
<unk> <unk> of the child that go inside.
Sometimes people tell me it seems to be playing <unk> or I remind them to be a little seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you're looking good at something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't see it well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there's no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for no one of this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A truly universal truth six words for you, the golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and again when people were approaching me this week just so I was using it, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to have emotionally emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart, and I go up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the <unk> and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these ends, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, that just like most other quantum mechanics, we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a sense of intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is that one thing says that one thing can be just one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy and I didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that parking lot of parking parking lot, he taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you will be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with battery bars and play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really weird -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point it was the physics some years ago; you need of quantum mechanics to describe those small particles.
But you didn't need the needed to describe the objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because we don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But they didn't fit very well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to broaden this a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then we get a big approach, the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little piece of metal, with a form of springboard and <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new, new chip and I started working on all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with <unk> <unk> which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am in an elevator alone, I do all sorts of rare things, but then when another people go up and let those things, because I don't want them to do it, or actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The teammates in inanimate objects are not just people, and it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that's going on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to be <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to take all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled all the air out of the air, and then you put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that he moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and the way it <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which is expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft thrust, we could make it <unk> and that we don't go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillions of atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> a clean room in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on a scale between one atom and that piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my sort of logic that we talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you get your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we <unk> it and we turned the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently every single objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics that claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my chief who's here and allowing me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining simply in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and art artwork.
So when I started traveling and <unk> I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show a demo to then give you a couple of interesting things that we've taken out of their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> Van <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, at <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around and you <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click inside.
They're within, they want to go at the end of the hall,
Let's keep forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I didn't get the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the sign <unk>
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information of <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image -- for example, <unk> I think, 10 million pixel away.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million pixel away.
You can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see some fun things going on.
I love this guy, his expression is no price.
But if you really want to get <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a <unk> on Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get further into depth and you'll see that you really can get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you'll actually see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk> play.
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same.
You can actually create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we go on -- I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just got around it.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things, you send them to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these things <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital means to your artwork to your artwork that is represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it responsive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian origin all the children in Italy growing up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in Formula races one in the last two decades.
For some time, if you wanted to win a session of Formula 1, I would take a budget and you put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and a pilot was good enough, you get the career.
This is what in engineering, it's <unk> control system control.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the control systems systems are beginning to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're being turned to the air.
And as <unk> are starting to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is big.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects.
This is from a <unk> exhibition at the end of the year during the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms they were <unk> sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outer environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old <unk> <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said to the end of the <unk> and he threw it to the Moses -- -- -- that you can actually see a little dent and he said, "You know, <unk> non <unk> -- and so what don't you think?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of picking up the environment and will push something.
Let's start with the chart.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year in Italy, won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end, the <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at activity happens in the net.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The line line is on the top.
At the late afternoon, there are people over here and there are making call called <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> in France.
<unk> people make a call to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, Italy, yeah!
That night they all went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister of the time.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to <unk> it is a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city pulse in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things we use and consume it.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in their shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle recently more than a year to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to all be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening complicated things and there's a lot of no need.
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> it doesn't exist, which is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we <unk> a day is still still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting <unk> and so many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we've talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
And it all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology can bring technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves and <unk> vacuum valves that open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you look at the pixels you can write on them, show patterns, images text texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we could happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the Mayor <unk>
I liked it a lot.
And we took a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows, no windows, but when you come up with it opens up so that you can go through.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you lower the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days there will always be someone, in the winter, when you go down the roof, somebody who was there, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost the whole architecture goes down.
Here's how it works.
You see the <unk> people on what's inside.
And here I am just trying to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night it was really even more fun.
All the <unk> kids came in the building, because the way we interact with it had changed a little bit.
It wasn't a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that kept making slices and holes in water, and you had to jump out to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, always think about using people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which moves with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, right?
kind of a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the position of the pixel above.
You can play it with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and size, in different kinds of resolution.
And then that then all of that could be a number of pixels in 3D that you can get near and start and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When light, the light looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of the people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of June dancers -- the star of the New York City <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as an entrance to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the capture in different <unk>
It's a lot of 3D <unk> in real time as a movement.
It can support the whole movement.
You can walk around the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a farm farm -- but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we go from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and Obama campaign, we can go through the digital world of the <unk> power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made out of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud is the pixel up.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered on the pixel Street.
You can move around the inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serve to share the major moments of the 2012 Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, as a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they might improve the <unk> by more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better form, it will be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure <unk>
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who were always wanted to be more creative.
What is it that you will tell you.
What if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people do you make creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> I probably owe the amount of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many <unk> <unk> <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference. But I want to give you the view of a doctor on the subject.
The great drama of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> in addition to the <unk> Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called <unk> in biology, it makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, right in one end is, of course, that interests us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin protein that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the more bacteria that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think ... when Antonio <unk> they ask you about the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully controversial environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, hot, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all of the nutrients that you can want to want without any effort in their part.
It's really like a rapid pathway for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush to the <unk>
But by the way, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance -- as a species?
Or meant to become something different, which is perhaps better <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms each cell divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two identical cells.
But when organisms come along, things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens -- the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body is in evolution in the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death, it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I was more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their late 90 years.
And one night someone hits your door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a gorgeous <unk> dancing dancer, of clothes.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"It's good, says, "I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to get us healthy.
I wanted to regain health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic charge to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think all of the sense that we put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to make the immortality through my work.
I want to be <unk> not <unk>
Evolution not necessarily favors longevity.
Not necessarily favors the biggest or the stronger or the stronger or the faster and even the smarter.
Evolution favors the creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only trial for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be used if there were fish there, <unk> fish in <unk> but you've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look ahead, the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and killed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that it would fit into us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we were so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation of the evolution of evolution.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the traditional type of traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution actually roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when you sort of <unk> distant planets are going to exist to the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, an intriguing and intriguing possibility of it.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and chosen for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider the reality that a lot of people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what it chooses to the individual and family level.
You also think that if it was possible to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You don't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
Human Genome Project started in 1990, he sued 13 years.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 to 20,000 than a week.
There's not a lot of a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and being increasingly in the reach of all.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to have <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine that we can do against flu <unk> in a plant of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's true today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies, but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life to remove diabetes -- eliminate the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want any more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology that can produce the changes of the science that can produce the changes in preventing diseases are going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a <unk> Ken <unk> especially if you could be able to get it into the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a bomb muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we would have turned the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years, and we can take it into 1,000 years, and maybe it happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices in order for a more successful more successful, more successful.
Or, let's choose selectively different attributes that we want to do for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that's more boring, and more uniform or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about flight <unk>
So immediately I looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that's not the way.
<unk> engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words that have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with a flight flying.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before we died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought all of the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't do that, all the fences that I wanted <unk> all the experiences I've wanted to have and never implemented.
While I was thinking about that, later on, I was a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I was looking at the bridge George Washington -- which was not very much -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I have lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave myself place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I think about things that didn't care with people who don't care about.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
Within two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock goes <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken into 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had a sense of it:
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to love myself, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was on a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> like a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I understood that the two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For everything, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was given a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and going to live in another way.
You know, you're flying today, the challenge that imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how do you start?
What are you going to think that you are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most cool thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
And one day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design design business and animation so that, of course, graffiti is something intricate we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that I <unk> seen Stephen <unk> it's not that all people with paralysis can be communicating through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be an important person, and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they are making it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check and rather than that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I stayed with her brother and his father there at the very moment, "OK, this is the thing: Tony is going to speak, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make their art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inner can't afford it.
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows you to project light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- they draw on that and record negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
First of all, you start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the <unk> attacks, and at the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so he started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot moving the things on one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that you could make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you're talking to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't know. This guy is great!"
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers around the world <unk> from every corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and when they <unk> would have taken the pictures out of the walls and they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the voyage of <unk> my son was part of my dog and created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a pair of <unk> sun <unk> we buy in the <unk> ride from Beach, which is some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, we put it together on a light of LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- we published the code <unk> the software becomes free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicating using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, two weeks of training, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot out of the hospital.
And he turned to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust into the parking lot, so we feel like we were eating graffiti as well.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what said, "This was the first time you draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and they would take me out of there so that I could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
That's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a great device, but it is the equivalent of a <unk> icon.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to go to work and do it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were like, "Oh, this is great!"
<unk> <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the <unk> inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that isn't possible, do it possible.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the computer -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some point.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I am not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you, guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations generally very difficult and at the same time as dangerous as dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
Film in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just a lot of fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a big part of my career I've been <unk> in situations in a little appearance with the only purpose of trying to examine social questions in ways that we would be able to examine interesting, and, hopefully analyzing analyzing them in a way that they look fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you don't have any idea and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said that, it's a very good opportunity to get to it.
Do you know how much people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title of progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I had no longer been able to afford it for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the marketing world of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've gotten into horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could be done -- nothing could be <unk> for something so difficult to get into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that is about the <unk> of product -- and the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film is ever <unk> is that everything above the top at all, and it has images of brand, all the time; all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the brand one.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the filmed for <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was just <unk> It was more for <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure <unk> all the categories of the film.
You may be able to take a shoe and get the most cool shoe that you <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink than you <unk> <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the full idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help me make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it is the first time I hear that -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it is going to be the people.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half -- I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth taking a couple of <unk>
You know, you know, you know, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look at us as a whole bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or for me.
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need a help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, it was to introduce the product to so many people as possible, to make that as much people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the media -- is not the idea of telling that new vehicle worth that it's going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that showed up.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or easily detected easily detected or easily detected <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- even CEOs -- even <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it something changes suddenly changes.
But why? Well, the transparency day <unk>  like that weird bear that still continues to be.
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's very risky.
What else is it <unk>
It was an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to businesses and telling them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to <unk> a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would get me in some lie -- and there he looks at me as he used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off the <unk> and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see is -- and that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big films, and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make a big Hollywood movies say the reason that their films have so much success is because the brands that they have.
And then my friends who do independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you very cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You look a little bit nervous.
I want to help you that you <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> <unk> to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind people is the reason that this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you <unk>
How do you keep you fresh time? With better <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about a common <unk>
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good parents.
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing traces of the sun, or I like the <unk> and the same way.
Woman: If Dan was a brand for a brand <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part <unk> <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
My little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is made because of <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand of Tom, but I would often stand up at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they could do it for them, they probably could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that we <unk> like people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: Next is this the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and how to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things, I like weird things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what is that?
What's the <unk> In what phase of <unk> you find now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to have a fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides but <unk> in your personality of <unk> your Morgan <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just going to lie in one of their strong points or the other instead of focus on both.
Many companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those items, and you actually give them something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there's <unk> <unk> and brands that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is something quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone tells you to <unk> your heads of brand, your personality <unk> what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you more good.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful as being playful as the <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more popular <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated <unk>
You're a traditional place, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> <unk> <unk> like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who were saying, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI to identify the <unk> centers in the brain as well as a commercial marketing centers like movies.
We went to San Paulo where they have forbidden the open air.
All over the city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where businesses are getting on the way in schools with money problems in the U.S.
And the amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the greatest response or that I've been most successful is those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> cut off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, which is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? they had success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we have had 900 million impressions about media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not on the line. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies that we talk about is telling their clients not to be part.
I have always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think that when you get people out of that that's pushing it to the failure.
I think that when you train their employees in loss is preparing for their own company to reward them for rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to be afraid of fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear -- <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to run transparency.
Today not a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a phenomenal question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization, the Foundation Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for the next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are in real time control systems.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes are not using <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, <unk> then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows <unk>
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these <unk> systems.
And that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they had very weird things.
<unk> <unk> as a rat rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at actively searching in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working in that place: is actually working in the past.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a <unk> power plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than the goal soon.
And so we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> bombs -- a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally <unk> people who obviously had all the internal information.
They were all the ones to attack.
You probably even know how much it goes down the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
So here you see a sample of this code.
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to <unk> with the real world, with potential goals in the real world.
We need the theories about they could pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white white and surely located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go to the nest <unk> so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in <unk> code.
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
So it wasn't like that.
The results have been from several weeks of hard work.
They were going to go down on dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would say to one single goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> little is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> communicate with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw -- really <unk>
There's the gray, and up there is the <unk>
So what this thing is doing is <unk> the input values of sensors for example, of the sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides <unk> code, which still run during attack, with false data <unk>
And believe it or not, this <unk> data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes down, you have to open <unk> gas <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> or the security system <unk>
<unk>
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is really important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could be working also, for example, in a energy plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this payload with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you did that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a huge number of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower, here.
There's one story, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, again, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and make <unk> abilities -- or another that makes you start chairs and come back again.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than anything you put in the morning, it gives you a great strength, which is also going to increase its speed, and it helps you, for example, to manage the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate and connect with the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we start talking about the American soldier who, on average, you have to take on your back for 45 pounds, and you can get it into getting even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help drive the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human Human Human
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can give you 90 pounds for land for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
So what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it goes up my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this <unk> this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's look at the look at the users of chairs from wheels, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in roughly, in the wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that is often happening very young people, with damage to the column that when they start their life -- 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that is older than being added to quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury on the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that are sending signals to the board, here on the back.
There are also some batteries that give the motors to the engines on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a stranger jump in the air, keeping it down <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost a whole sense of feeling and all the movement of her nose down.
Shortly after, a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said to me, <unk> you never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole me until the last bit of hope of hope of self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs me to <unk> it costs rocks and climb rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just from soldiers, but then we got to all the users of chairs from the wheels, to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of <unk> <unk> of Congo.
<unk> are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest relatives <unk>
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done a lot of emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, <unk> the society Bonobos are in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where mortal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforests -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been flooded for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also put in danger by survival of the Bonobo.
The beef trade and deforestation will make you not fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure that.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden and hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as the ape <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> sex -- <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity since the life of the Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us and the game is critical to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With him learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors of connections.
And when you look at the game phase, Bonobos can see the roots of the laughter, the same of the laughter, the dance and the human dream.
The game is the glue that came together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos of videos in the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> has <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common both in bonobos like humans.
And this video is really interesting because it <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is of most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to do this -- this is <unk> a young man, who's playing with <unk> water.
I think that like that, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world to more creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world of success to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's bring it to the maximum capacity of game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and human <unk> it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the least appropriate way to play, you can be the moments when it is the most urgent thing.
So in that, fellow primates, accept this gift of evolution and play together while they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a volunteer <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers meet a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But still, there was a career at foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain and figure out what our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that surely was through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and she was on her home in flames.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>   came to the captain first to the captain and he asked her to go on and would save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, he would have to tell people that I entered a building in call to save a living alive just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to have the house.
I need <unk> <unk> the fire, and she brings this woman a couple shoes."
I promise you.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I went down the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went back to the fire firemen that went down to the back of the hall, went to that height of the fire and entered the fourth room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house of the house house where, as he would expect, his treasure. received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the owner of the house <unk> for the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she watched for the other was that someone had reached a couple of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my <unk> as a physician, volunteer is witness to generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of grace and courage acts at the individual.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have achieved, or they are by <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you about this.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to <unk> <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a park.
Be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's lives, but each day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So they enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I am a big fan of the concrete block in the concrete block.
The first block of concrete have been built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement in a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges or a brick at once.
So essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to all the home.
It's estimated that they've been made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> I just took the concrete block of concrete, <unk> in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> <unk> about others to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block of concrete, the transistor allows you to create much greater and more complex, one brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I don't personally know that that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
About eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing is that they come together with magnets.
So you can't get them in a wrong way.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is over, the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange is the wire and the <unk>
So only you have to assemble a blue with a green one and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue blue with a green one is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse of pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make you <unk> faster or slower, just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to look at them ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels all must be accessible.
We have given the kids to get them to play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light of night works or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without expertise in electronics start to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we had <unk> the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island -- that they don't have any experience in engineering, just wood and paper and said, "Do you get something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk> movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage the world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment focusing on.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> right now.
You can take a little bit about <unk>
We can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and put them to work with <unk>
Instead of <unk> the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They did great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> to <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would look for a quote, but what it really looks for is that someone has to clean up when they get caught up on the snow because it knows it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered in a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help in this way <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment they were very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else else that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks in front of them.
So it made any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
Do you accept <unk>
By doing so, you put a name, in this case, he put it <unk>
If you don't do, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a uprising.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the tiniest <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
It spreads <unk>
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this application realized that he could use it not for snow, but for citizens to get <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people steals the batteries.
That's why the citizens <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know nine cities that we used to use using it.
And this has spread out of <unk> and natural and natural.
If you know a little bit of government technology will know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that in fact that the normal channels have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the court of California that until the moment has leaves 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days, and it spreads in a viral form is a kind of just shot off the warning of the government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private enterprises, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without 1986, in the open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the issue of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a lot of frustration in front of that, but they didn't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we stop side, the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that we get crazy about, the government is essentially in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone don't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you, because things are changing.
The politics is not <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately grows out of us -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is above all, a matter of <unk>
This is the center of health care for service and information.
It's the place that calls calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This call.
He entered the foundation of official knowledge.
I did nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put music very hard and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So good for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a mobile application, and a mobile application, called the <unk> <unk>
Don't make that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happens, this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of crap. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do that for <unk>
<unk> dynamics are different.
Scott was talking about it.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage bucket behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I gave the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet nights, <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical thinking.
And it's also a great example of the government income to the distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get together and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could have been connected with government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps the other, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people would say that, but think you're the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to be a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will prescribe our values and make our needs, but we then don't see changes.
That's because the government is like a huge ocean, and politics is the shallow <unk> layer, of <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot contempt.
But it is that <unk> what it belongs to us that we have to have something that we funded as something that is operating in our against.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that we will have to make bureaucracy, it's sexy.
Because it's where the real job of government is.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> in the government, is time for us to ask ourselves, what world do we want to leave with our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't take care of government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function of the government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of our members of our members is 28 years old, so I <unk> I'm a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everybody will talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem you don't really care about making their voices.
They're using your hands.
They put hands to the work to program applications that do better for the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking away from <unk> dumping a trash bucket inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, not only are we government consumers that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of these, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a swarm of voices, or we'll also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, jails and death <unk>
I've spent the most part of my life in <unk> communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And to be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> I've given a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here has impact all over the world.
At times, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we see fantastic talk.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can make a lot of sense, but if you teach feeling that they can have a special meaning to it.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve a lot more.
And so I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of right, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, it was power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia Tech.
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with <unk> <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but she was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at her, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug to me.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then breathe on me.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approaching me and said, "I still feel my <unk>
And if she said no, I was going to love it again and if I was telling him yes, I kept in peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
At times, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and attention.
My cousins were running around everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it and she looked at her, but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she stood up, and she got up, I took my hand out of the room, and he said, "Come on <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
And he took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't get it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I will never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just do I want me to ask me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to ask you, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> -- so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want to tell you, is that you're always going to do the right thing if the right thing is <unk>
I thought it and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do is that I never got <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> -- so <unk>
I grew up in the field, South rural. I have a brother and a younger year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and we went for the forest.
We just got doing the <unk> of the time.
He took a drink of beer, offered my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. I'm going to <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> Today you get it, and you always do the same thing as us.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going up? Take a <unk>
And I went into the look with force and <unk> "Oh, not going to be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this will be spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that they don't really see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been inmate during the <unk>
My guys died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that were that, according to her, we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than what it was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In the poor or a black communities, it finds so much <unk> so much of these facts.
One in three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> throughout the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Baltimore -- 50 to 60 percent of all color young people in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a judicial system that makes it much better if you're rich and innocent. than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results of the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not any problem.
Are we <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at a few good developments in our work.
In Alabama, so in Alabama, as in other states, you give you the rights for always if you have an criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black men have lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we put it up to the next 10 years the level of the loss of rights to be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The U.S. is the only country in the world where it was killed by 13 children to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no possibility of getting out again.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in the death <unk>
This matter of death death is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way of how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by <unk> crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by mistake.
Out of nine people have identified an innocent person who is <unk> and released from death <unk>
It was a mistake, <unk> an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it wouldn't allow you ever to fly airplanes if every nine who was <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue that we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> I talk to you about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know much about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches the talks, you <unk> <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with for the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, <unk> <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was, obviously, with segregation and decades of subordination and <unk>
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we're going to do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage ourselves with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome the race of race without a compromise and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany teaching <unk>
It was fascinating because one of the teachers were stopped after my presentation and said, "You know it's good disturbing to listen to what you would get.
<unk> "We have no death in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room was quietly and a lady said, "There is no way that we have our history, we can never get into systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> we could <unk>
So let's think about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, and <unk> to people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We could not get it out.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But recently, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, and <unk> <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
So lately we've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, those will never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so committed to the intellectual <unk>
It comes with creativity, development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the <unk>
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering, we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think is even in communities like TED, it should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to really be human if we don't pay it for equal attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the big privilege being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were gathered together to speak.
Occasionally, lady was called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to bring them together to talk.
You want to come and look at them.
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
And then she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you are."
I read <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, my <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give it my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront the prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom.
We try to do something about the death row.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and at the end of the end, and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> got to me and put my finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those issues, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher than the worst we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't tell you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's it.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very, very beautiful, very <unk> <unk> you don't judge our technology, for our design or not for our intellectual or rational.
At the end of the way, the character of a society, not the way to treat rich and powerful people, but in the way to the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients for 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so they would become like adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can an judge to turn someone into what is not it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night I was very late in <unk> -- God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 customer for 14 years.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my 14-year-old black customer is treated like a privileged white <unk> executive from a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there had been a <unk> behavior in the <unk> of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had been <unk> it was sent to court.
For about two months, I had forgotten it.
And then I finally got my God, I have to go to the cut for this he's stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. He went to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man -- he was the <unk> of the court.
When he looked at me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I came up with me and <unk>
And I got into the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
By the inside, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk>
People started to go. Everyone was <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came up the cops and the prosecutors and the prosecutors to the <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people -- and everybody is talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I hit the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I was looking at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
I was walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black black, with a head of concern, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant dashed on the old black black.
And he said, "You know, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood stood up, I looked at me and he looked at me and he said, "Let's go to this audience of audiences to tell this young man who would keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very large, but it folds into justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is tied to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to be an effort to <unk> the funds you spend today in <unk> policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the cases in homicide not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes don't get to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make it the law for safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it is said that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> to rob a bicycle, a little bicycle by little crimes against property -- instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment is nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got to be excited about here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> The threats for Bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be from the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of the day our senses are getting so much more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And because nothing matters to us, the first stop of all those data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe, called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us damage.
And so from a <unk> of stories, looking at the <unk>
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong on worse.
But maybe it won't.
Maybe what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps huge progress in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the species extinction -- the scarcity of water and <unk> we have no doubts about them.
As human beings, we are very good at overcoming the problems, and in the long time, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average per capita income has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Also, the cost of food in the electricity, of transportation and communications, has dropped from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy happened 25 percent to more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people will be <unk>
And we followed <unk> expectations more and higher expectations.
In fact, they <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of with such <unk>
So much of this is technology and recently, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> on information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to notice two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and peace, in recession, in depression and <unk>
It's the launch of speed computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop to any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on the left to the left, it's going to go up up.
The growth rate is itself faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite computing computing and the ability to democratize personalized production and <unk> that personalized production across the planet, biology, synthetic biology, fuels and food, and food, digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was spade.
I looked for the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: this: <unk> <unk> to human beings."
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to all on your cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can be positively going to affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> of the 1800.
He's the guy on the left.
They will dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with <unk> <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was more than gold and <unk>
So this is why the tip of the Washington level, in Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as pure metal <unk>
It's tethered to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
We take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about <unk> but of <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study showing that it shows that in the late decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, the solar power will cost six cents a <unk> compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have the abundance of energy we also have a abundance of water.
Let's now talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager Voyager toward Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
It was a famous photograph. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought by the <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, I gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is capable of generating a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any <unk> saltwater, water <unk> <unk> <unk> by less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola is just thought to make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out good, and I have full confidence that this is going to be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications communications in Kenya than the President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell a smartphone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of information and communications that nobody could have ever predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video images, <unk> images of books and music, and music, <unk> diagnosis -- now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best comes in when you get health applications in.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging teams of the world to be able to bring these technologies into a mobile device where they speak, and because it has <unk> you can be able to get the blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a <unk> medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that we don't want to call the health of health and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines of here are the population.
We've just got the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection protection is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before they add to global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you do? What <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy of the Academy and because of 3D impressions and computer computing will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion members of mankind, healthy <unk> and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
So what if we give them up, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What did these 3,000 billion?
And if you are contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams guided by their passion with a goal of course, can do things like things that could only be done before they could only do big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
You have played with this professors in college professors, each other.
And then hundreds of thousands of people joined each other, and they started <unk>
And it's shown that today the pattern of recognition of human patterns is better at folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three million new minds that are going to get us together to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades in front of decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross in the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a resource in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from <unk>
There was <unk> from about 20 meters, the black beard, <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was raised over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
<unk> at five inches.
We put a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of developing projects.
The fishing development was to impose into countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty good is called The <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in southern China from the East of China, and above all, in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs -- tiny on some <unk> of the remains that are a coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the mall.
The bottom line of being a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
I don't know. The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to tell you, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it wasn't <unk>
We <unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
They would start the point of starting to start at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> things on the Y-axis, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use images in the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing and then extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the progression of changes.
And then the end will keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in great measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that don't are, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies will kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that it was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a way earlier -- it's not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them would make some of us as a captain of a <unk> can be used in this area can't be used or, usually they don't use the scientists of the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on sources of the past.
From there a huge role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with the marine zones of the protected areas, we really visualize our past.
So what happened is the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point has been run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine area, and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the Middle West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is an Bay simulation of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay bay -- 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were so touched by the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why would you go with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is Cameron, <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are made as viral and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper realities in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can get famous on the Internet in a <unk>
It goes up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a little percentage of these, gets a myriad of views and makes a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot out of his house in Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the collections of popularity last summer.
<unk> didn't say to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> He published this we'll come to the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> is presented to us new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on the end of the week, the end of a week.   You all want me to go on on a Friday. On the Friday.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows how often use use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what happened to this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and a lot of blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science Science was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends embrace a view of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
As a difference of the 20th century, the 20th century, this community involvement is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an interactive animation with a <unk> music.
So, that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats you saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up among the online community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody did an old version of the old one.
And then it became international <unk>
All of a sudden, there was a whole community of <unk> which made it like a silly joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video were coming up two days of video per minute, just the only thing that unexpected and unexpected can be made in the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't really interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you properly from <unk>
KA: KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and his humor, Casey <unk> did it that five million of you saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth for everything else that we do <unk>
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> business communities of participation, the fully unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- a new culture, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popularity of popularity
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't allow me to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're just the media of today's media, but <unk> the future entertainment.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only one and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
You know, the words, for so long, friends, now I get it.
They were <unk> in silence.
He died by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 as only 18 years when his father died, and a marriage marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task to escape her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do this.
And then from a four years ago that defies fiction, a boat slid into the sea dressed in <unk> ship.
All of the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the traffickers rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> <unk>
If we first asked us, we first took my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the whole duration and vacuum.
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not to be able to start for six hours.
But I remember remember the lights out of the platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, end the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I did, given for the men on the pad.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is comprised of immigrants from us.
Unlike the middle suburbs <unk> whose existence I <unk> in <unk> had no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the chunks of English English is <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a <unk> assembly line, working six days, <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree on <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and math, wouldn't mind what was supposed to be, which was usually <unk> that was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were moving around our day and I would see the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares were going to start to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and she opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition, angry and <unk> and boys were trapped between two worlds.
They took subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the <unk> classical student with what I was trying to do.
In the other, it was <unk> in <unk> lifetimes, tragically <unk> by violence, abuse of drugs and isolation.
But many people got help through the years.
And by that work, when I was studying my last year of pregnancy, they picked me the young Australian boy of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but their edges don't know.
As <unk> resident <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist -- invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence she'd never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to withdraw the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age as she had when she got into the ship.
It had never been an option.
<unk> told me, "What are you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all of the paths of life, many of them doing what they were going to do, living on the edge of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a new design in the scene -- and not just that it's right, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that had not been <unk> were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism that was very humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people who slogan cannot <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, it was a giant pot of soup that we all have <unk>
They go back to the entrance to night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, we open up step.
It took the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk>
Three months later I had <unk> and the adventure of <unk>
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared about.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
And my mother grew up.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, it caused an <unk> to the <unk> and to bring the cause and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't show it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel hotel when she died, <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and how we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> their hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
They don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life we were and how life evolved we now can see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have been easily.
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might wish that to you?
However, the privilege of the easy, in the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, you're going to be brave in every wave, the <unk> pace of engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and you can see them -- it would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of course, is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians we wanted to travel to a car and you get off the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was <unk> the great Indian warrior Brazilian <unk> he was <unk> he pulled out a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we got was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very excited about that.
Every time I felt a little bit more than <unk>
And I was struck by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic to be <unk>
My grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of technology for 50 years was for my most <unk> thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile clocks, the luxury clocks and the cameras keep <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I became fascinated with this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
It took books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where do we are.
<unk> the text with the image, the animation, the sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that be?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I got a character from the book.
At a number of moments it comes to me -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- which is led to me.
My little girl inside all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood -- to those ideas that we use of children.
For some reason, fireflies in the jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we need to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they light up your way into what my members of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy would be made in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> which I drag towards this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all of that fantasy has always been maps but static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content and a contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the P.C. cameras for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's history <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> glued to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure in which we have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the kids don't know.
So to get this childhood ritual out of childhood you have to go out and, in a chapter, you get a picture of a flower and then you go.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside the kind of connection between magic, Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you get out of the iPad and video on and the video would actually go and through augmented reality.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to make the sound of wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are attached to technology and magic and technology gets closer to another.
It would be the energy of the sun.
We are moving into our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you do?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or maybe not everyone, but most of the projects of <unk> fail to stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a doorknob and closed <unk>
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I started the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I get married, you send my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is -- not at the same time when I needed <unk> or any urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I climb up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available from next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or a device.
And people would take care of their houses, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor -- and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to regain the control and be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care of health because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention care, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share it with you with a video of a video.
We all have checks <unk>
Maybe we have it on our phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs in <unk>
Now where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked it, but nobody <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, when it's open, because sometimes they open up in <unk> <unk> and they are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was looking for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> <unk> to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone else can use your iPhone, and then the next few weeks will use their cellphone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we would be <unk>
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and work like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> it can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You could be messaging services, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please take care of this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was awakened to my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
I mixed up with my prior passion for drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in planning that process.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when you press <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
You know, we have a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a reality of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the reality level.
And when I say argument, I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you will have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real.
They're the details or the <unk>
He <unk> the light?
What is it that creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you an easy example.
Here we have three perfectly objects, which we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways can create something that still looks like <unk> as if it was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's go to the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look realistic I think they're those in which we don't even understand the things that are around us in our daily lives.
But when you combine pictures is very important -- because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image is <unk>
Here's another example.
So you might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places.
You know, I think it's easier to create a place that you find -- because you don't need to put the ideas on the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find out the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, I even made the red house the top of the island to seem more <unk>
So to get an realistic result of it, I think it takes planning.
You always start with an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you make the photos the result can be very beautiful, and at a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a little bit about technology, very boring.
You can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a folder.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details, but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is sort of a straight line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something weird happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we use technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if I draw them on a normal curve that you say, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to make -- the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you go for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a <unk>
If the transit technology technology is as fast as the <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't happen to that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development of economic growth, which every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves. We see that you are not still forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
It's one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a typical curve, I know like this until you come up with something completely different, or maybe it will be something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world used to be, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, is what is that new way that you adopt the world?
What new state is the world going.
The transition looks very, very confusing, if we're embedded in it.
I remember the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
It's a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it's all going to be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how you might be, how could that transition that you <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about two and a half billion years ago when the Earth was a big rock rock with a lot of chemicals that would spread around them.
If we look at the way that chemicals organized we give us a sense of how things happened to happen.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was about <unk> of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside its inside.
Some of those blobs of oil drops a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials out of the outside and the drops grew of <unk>
They started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, drops them in some way -- it's being <unk> being better at the time to incorporate the chemical <unk> <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
Mostly, they lived over time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, very simple life, but things became interesting when these droplets people learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a system of writing that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to be able to record it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes are exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> We can now write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of dust from white powder that I try to hide the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> and the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it took it 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happily be happy another billion years.
But then another big step occurred in which things were very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming the cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to they would build communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and established a <unk>
From that <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point occurred when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe out of the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as one organism alone.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart of the heart, or the muscles in the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and caused more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
They started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not doing more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmitting information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time like <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not in the evolutionary period of time.
So one organism, I could, for example, learn how to eat some fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had before that data processing structures that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit from the dying.
So the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most important version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an amazing invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea in my head.
I'm here sitting here with a few <unk> and, hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated that you turn it into sound, in sequences of sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, like mankind, we've started to perform <unk>
We now go through similar periods to organisms -- we have our <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the video tape -- the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> which produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I would tell you about took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, it took about hundreds of millions of years.
The following, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose, is the right word to name something which accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that employment for <unk> would not be possible without the traditional digital developments in recent computer.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that something that you didn't do, it gets a lot more far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using recently, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of chance?
You could run these sequences of random instructions to run all those programs, and take those who are more excited to do what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to tidying up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that they do <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> to the rest.
And now it <unk> the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog <unk> <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of <unk> programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
Some mutations are born.
And it tries to try again and start with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in such complicated, in a few minutes, in a few months.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are going to be able to be absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to pick them together to see how they work.
They're very strange English programs.
But they get <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the security that they achieve because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
Once I went on a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and he pulls out a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight. It doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
However, we don't understand the whole options that there are.
It goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
So, it is <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
Are we <unk>
And we're at a moment of analog to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that we are all part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get in.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up part of my fake <unk>
Before I treat the theme of my talk, talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to go out with <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of the <unk> that I gave up 300.
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game field without being <unk> and anyone who is trying to <unk> the first base, not in time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three attempts at 10.
You know how they call a <unk> <unk>
Well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk> of <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 <unk> I get four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League minister of <unk> in running more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now let's go to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm telling you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are derivatives to a surgeon who has a record of 400 at <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a distant place and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derived to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting a remarkably better year.
And the hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think it should be the average of hits from a heart surgeon or <unk> from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
Thank you very well.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do is, though, is sending them into the world, and I was included, with the weather to be perfect.
I never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was an obsessional student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> was going to go for a blood test.
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the General General General School of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> psychiatric diagnosis and <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis of how to classify <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good. I graduated with <unk>
And I think of my school school with the impression that if I did everything, then you would know everything, or the closest thing about the everything, because this is how I get away from the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the emergency service service where I worked out.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room comes to a cardiologist and I was going to go to that patient.
It will inform the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which sent me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are filling in blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment that I read about it.
I gave him <unk> and medication to ease the pressure on her heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt great.
And that was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more <unk>
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, I didn't do what I should have done, he was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that would take constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
As I send it to his house, he didn't pay attention to a voice in my inside that said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't you <unk>
In fact, I was so insecure and I was asked to tell the nurse that I would say to the nurse <unk> "Do you think it's OK if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high school and the ambulance next with the ambulance he took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, in the stomach.
But I kept with my work.
At the end of the day, I went back to leave the hospital and walked towards the parking lot where I was my car to go home. At that moment I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, and I was home.
I went through the emergency emergency service house.
And there another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another one said to me three words -- those three words that most of the emergency doctors <unk>
Other specialists who fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: you remember you?
"It remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In the course of an hour of having come to his house, after I gave her the high school, he suffered the ambulance and his family brought the emergency room to the emergency room with a blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock <unk>
I just barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency personnel personnel all their resources.
They gave her medication to raise your blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
It had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and expected against all hope that they <unk>
And in the two or three days, the next two days was clear that we never <unk>
He had an <unk> damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they were going to become what was going on.
And the ninth day, they let him go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks before, I was passionate about it, and I experienced for the first time the shame <unk> that exists in our medical culture, and I felt just <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that did.
And it wasn't for me, he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure they would take the things and make sure that I didn't get paid.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> I mean, why made it a mistake that <unk>
Why chose I chose <unk>
Little to little that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, it opened up the sky and finally came out the sun and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if you were to look at efforts to be perfect to not make any more mistakes, I would take away those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back.
Two years later, it was an interview in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He was <unk> penicillin and sent him to his house.
But while he ran to the door was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> shift my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made three words, you remember this?
Remember the patient he saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I had no <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but the upper area, and that can cause the close of those tracks.
He did not she died.
It <unk> antibiotics and <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were thrown at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
It was an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out normal. A colleague who was checking the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read it liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to get it out.
I checked it up and notice some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, he called the surgeon.
Both were operated on, they recovered as well.
But every single case is <unk> me <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after crap!
Of course in a party you'll hear about the errors of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- she would have a hard time to look at her eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The full denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> that they make mistakes and the ones that matter, the ones that don't sleep, and the ones that have <unk> outcomes and what they have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you take care of medicine to people who make mistakes.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and journalism, I've done a personal <unk> of bad litigation and mistakes medical to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Star Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors happen every single day, in which one of every 10 drugs will come in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where infection infections are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24 of <unk> medical errors in this country.
The U.S. Medical Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is added every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get married, and we eliminate all the professionals to mistake, well, you won't get anyone.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art, <unk> is my worst <unk> I would say to you, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, <unk> "this is my worst <unk> blah, blah, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- "What are your <unk>
And their students were <unk> <unk> the head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, you don't get the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical <unk>
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human, you know the human being, accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to do it to learn from what happened to teach others.
And they would take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and for all of them to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans are running the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel so much but effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I memory.
You know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
Recently I did a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to pick a half a half a half a day.
Not a lot, in a research followed by a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of these executives and the time that we would try to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Now obviously, every job in which we had a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the <unk> of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How is the way the way that these decisions?
Today, I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and about potential solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your response is positive for you, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of the overload of <unk>
Thank you.
As a graduate student at Stanford University, the University of really, really <unk> at least at that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a park in <unk>
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of water <unk> and this was when we collect water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion I asked myself, why never buy nothing?
This is the shelf on the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from trees.
I once decided to go to a manager and I asked him, "Do you do well this strategy to offer all of these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hallway.
They had a lot of different kinds of kinds of kinds of things.
I put a handle on the edge of the store.
We put out there -- six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to try and test the <unk>
More people stopped at the time when there was a decade ago that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
From those who stopped when there was only three percent arrived to buy <unk>
Back when I had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we are probably good at less -- it's good to conserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choice affects us in good <unk> decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where the decisions are about savings for retirement from about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested to see if the number of offers to fund savings plans for retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was really a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the funding was the number of funds, they had less participation.
So if we look at the extreme. We see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that you offer about 60 funds, the rate of involvement went to the <unk> 60.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more options, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater the number of options, more people would be able to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences to get more and more possibilities.
It will be more likely to make the decision, even though it goes against the self-interest of interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and in health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though you'll see it better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we're not able to do the calculations for comparing and choosing that amazing <unk>
Today I want to <unk> four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test them in your business.
The first thing is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than that.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you decide to cut, to get rid of <unk> options, there will be a <unk> increase in sales, the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & 15, and 15, you saw 10 percent in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products to fall from cats that less <unk> was increased by <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and less costs.
You know that the supermarkets of today, they have 45,000 products.
In a Walmart shop, it's offered about 100,000 products.
But the nine largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce?
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged from how to manage the choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard show.
All the employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to a safe fund of life.
Those who really want to choose, they give them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these choices are <unk>
The first thing I do is to ask <unk> <unk> the differences that there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, neither can they do their <unk>
This session, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a few vacation with all the paid to the world's most beautiful road.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the offer <unk>
<unk> applause) OK. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really did hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first round, that in the second way, but I can tell you that they thought the second time it was more real.
Because the images were making it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the overload of choice that is <unk>
So people understand differences among options, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very <unk> very concrete,
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when you use debit cards or credit cards that when you use it <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to <unk> more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> staff of <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> on a <unk> plan.
And to the meeting that we were looking at exactly how we <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we had the staff to think of the positive things that they would think of in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their stock accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a corridor of magazines.
We saw that in retail supermarkets throughout the <unk> of the <unk> show can contain from <unk> different kinds of different kinds of <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two jewelry.
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to be <unk> not than the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of fundraising.
Who are supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
So it turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think about -- if just <unk> a little bit.
We have to increase behavioral complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a nice decision that you buy a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that gives each one.
<unk> color outside of the car, I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box. Four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a few times four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> at 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How do you are.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of options like <unk> <unk> the button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they go there.
Same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order that the information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although we pick the box of changes not to say nothing about the preferences of interior decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
And to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of a <unk> <unk> eliminating alternate alternatives -- we can make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories by less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented with them were designed to help drive <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful the <unk>
And the more we're careful about our choices better we can practice art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in East East Germany, if you had a writing machine, it had to be tested in the government.
I had to register a sheet of example written with the machine.
And this for government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a script with the wrong message they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would be a lot that <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big producer and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow dots on every page that follows a pattern that makes them yourself and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, huge amounts of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that we would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media by illegal <unk> to steal money from our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy in a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> You're <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> that of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong on worse.
In the future, most crime crime <unk>
The second group of <unk> that we see today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, the protests, they motivate them to understand them, they motivate them to understand them.
And people like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a big role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, <unk> them like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the national United States of the governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
<unk> the bottom fall of the fall because of a <unk>
He took security from the site and taken a <unk>
Last week, I asked the Dutch government representatives asked one of the Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if you <unk> <unk> the death of people who are causing the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a attack on these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign <unk>
And that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> that happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters who were <unk> the <unk> headquarters in April <unk> in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
The papers was this folder called <unk>
And inside that folder there was some notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
And so, the Western governments provide the tools to the governments to be able to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
The Internet connection.
So we even had tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it looks like something bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to be <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play privacy.
<unk> aren't <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today will be forever.
Let's read about any future government in a management we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that should be worried about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and the bottom, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi doesn't have fractal in the most part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, they go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that they killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it very bad -- because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
People were dying in our community and livestock and livestock are also angry at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in Yellowstone National Park.
A kid in my community, in the age of six to the nine years is responsible for livestock of his father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions were afraid.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because it was even helping the lions to see the pen <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to cheat lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So I went out and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day the lions didn't come from.
They found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch to turn on and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp from a <unk> <unk>
It would be everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery -- the electricity in the small box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give out the outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see the lions when they come from night.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble having lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
<unk> you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by Kenya, to scare other predators, as hyenas, <unk> and it's also using for <unk> elephants as well.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a fellowship at one of the best schools in Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to fix them.
So a year ago, it was just a kid on the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes flying and said that someday would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and to lions, we can be with lions without a conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't know how exciting it is to listen to a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next on your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do an electric fence about it.
<unk> I know that there were no already invented <unk> <unk> but I want to make mine.
CA: You know, I read it once, right? I have tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the end of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> in every step that I would make my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was very proud.
In school, we would move all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot from the rest of the world, except for America, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
But sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That he said, "When we <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
I was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
As long as I was walking in front of the railroad station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at his face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A massive famine tied to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and crust of tree.
They also made more and more frequent energy bills, everything around it was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite photo from North Korea at night compared to the countries of the neighbors.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as an Afghan <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans North China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was done, when I was arrested for the Chinese police, and I was <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake report -- she's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many people can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> had eventually been released after a harsh international pressure.
These Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that the Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be embedded in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to take a lead to South Korea to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Africa.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even through a crisis of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call out of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I began to study for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities <unk> some money that sent my family, and as a punishment my family was going to be moved to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
The Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Africa.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to do it somehow, for over 3,000 kilometers across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and talked about a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of all and started asking them questions.
As my family could not understand Chinese, I thought my family was arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the guards go to <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to go and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man, asking me, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and cutting them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why do I get me?"
"I don't <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown <unk> is a new hope for me and for the village to <unk> when they were more about it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But to achieve its freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with little or not any money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language, and more of the English language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us follow in contact with the family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans in the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South.
This is <unk> <unk> stores and <unk> food, <unk> land.
So the planners of the city came together and thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed it to South African Los Angeles as if this is actually going wrong in the city.
This is the South African L.A.  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other American Americans, in a food desert -- South African <unk> home to the food places to take and eat in the car.
What's curious about it is that food places to kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in the South African village.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 kilometers away.
And I would stop seeing this happening.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of the house -- you see the effects that you think that the current food system is in their <unk>
I see wheels <unk> and sold like <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I just got tired of running 45 minutes from back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, that was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters -- x <unk>
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to run it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes me in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we put together and we started to plant our forest forest trees -- <unk> trees -- you know, nine fantastic vegetables.
What we do, we are kind of a group of paid paid from gardeners of all the <unk> from all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone would be <unk>
The city went on to me, and I just gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court order for planting food in a piece of land that no one would be <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's try it.
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. was written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, why not?
L.A. is the city city with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of land <unk>
That's about 20 <unk>
That's enough space for planting million water plants.
Why on Earth does it look like this?
It will take a <unk> 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars to result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you grow your own food.
You get your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up in there, and my children in there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, they're my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if you leave it canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became an education tool, of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the land.
You can see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one time that came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night and they were in my yard, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people that I was so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes for people to go to rob your <unk>
So I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid you're going to go to <unk>
That's the street in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter for <unk> at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared his stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We had, like about 50 people that come, and they work and they are going to be volunteers.
If kids are growing up, kids will eat <unk>
If they grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you're not taught how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind what you put in front of them.
I look at young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're messing in, I see color boys who are on this way that are designed for them, which leads them to nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I did not tell you."
I'm not talking for free, because free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people working on the street, and they get to know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Are you going to take them, take your <unk> right?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I won't be called if you want to sit in the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
strong. Thank you.
Thank you.
  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very good road.
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water on the asphalt that we would take on.
And especially if you go to your bicycle and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, it's very close to the cities, we want a road <unk>
The solution for that is to make highways of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the highways of the Netherlands, it has pores and water can go through it, so all the water of rain flow down the sides and you will have a road because it's easy to drive, and you don't get water to be <unk>
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open -- all the noise away, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this highway rocks on the surface of the surface goes out of the surface of the surface on the surface of the surface on the surface of the surface of the surface on the surface of the surface.
So first a stone, then several more and more and more, and so forth, and we say, well, I won't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see what damage is in this material.
It's an asphalt <unk> as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you're <unk> they're going to be <unk> and <unk> from <unk>
So, if you drive the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into small pieces, and we can mix those little pieces of pieces with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like what you see here, you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can change, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel -- melt the <unk> the flow of these <unk> and the rocks go back to the surface.
Today, I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat heat the shows.
We test a lot of samples out there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we took a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to make a lane test to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and try them in the lab.
We did the samples, we put them a lot of payload on them, the assumptions then with our <unk> machine and the assumptions and we came back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using patterns of steel, steel, these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the highway surface -- even you can double the life of the surface of the road, you actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about this as well.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it does.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember I have aroused a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News in his little gray radius.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those days, because the news is usually <unk>
<unk> <unk> She screamed my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made it illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was struck as a child to get my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could be suspicious of where they <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market in order to look like that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it was extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives and the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, school suddenly loved a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
We were <unk>
Did you know where it was <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan. It was that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father would get it.
But my mother <unk> became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember that there were moments that I was very frustrated for our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father would say, <unk> daughter of mine, you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. They can be able to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than my age, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I am proud to graduate school in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He's not just <unk> from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm driving through the streets in Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I dream big, but my family has even more big dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why we <unk> <unk> the first and probably the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> by them, despite the time in front of a opposition opposition.
As a <unk> It's not his name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter were going on from <unk> to her village, and literally was complaining about being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I got to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would go back to trying.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but you don't harm the future of my daughter for your old and <unk> ideas."
What I've given to me from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and she sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> the girls who went to school in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But over three million girls are going to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And they would argue that these changes didn't last long, after the retirement of the U.S. army.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents that I <unk> for them, I see a future <unk> and lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for <unk> and every day, the girls of <unk> I would love it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
"You've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the wavelength of mass <unk> as much as the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of rage and starting a revolution against the Tunisian regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were at the edge, <unk> the fall of the regime, carrying billboards of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown the courage <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of a brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 people dead -- we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved to myself, with many other women, rebuild civil civil society, <unk> a distributed <unk> and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation,
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique unique one, I started to organize workshops about developing capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the <unk> of women who are <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> orientation to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of women and for our right of involvement in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> than they were <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won an <unk> of National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little enough, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day of violence.
We woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk>
Another <unk> with the news of the murder of the U.S. ambassador, and the attack on the <unk>
Another day, we woke up with the news of the murder murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their handwashing human rights violations.
Our society, made out of a <unk> mindset -- more and away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> and vengeance became the icons of the revolution.
I'm not here today for <unk> with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we choose to choose the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with the selfish policies of domination and <unk> as well as men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than we needed the election, that just <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of women who will need the representation of <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting like an outrage of outrage, and I call the days of anger.
We need to start acting like agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but to also put it into practice <unk> instead of <unk> -- the collaboration instead of competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideal that an Libya, <unk> by war, desperately desperately desperately desperately desperately desperately needing to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in a existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> women and <unk> that spans all the humanity of the men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is giving all the existence.
So this is what "My <unk> is <unk>
This is what "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That all of them will be given the good for mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a sensible question that has an equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that they all make good for why she's left?
Why would anyone stay with a man who would tell him about a man.
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old, I was just <unk> at the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, which I believed my alma mater, me to hold my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved one in this world, he put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been nearly 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can move to anyone, all races, all the religions, every day, every day of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the families, the last place where we want or we would expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was left with a man on her and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started to <unk> me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he had just had a college of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed a guy in the field.
He had some big <unk> like <unk> and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
So we started out and loved all of me, who was ready that I had gone to Harvard, that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And it was so that <unk> in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was going from New York and leaving my dreams, but I thought I had to do it for your dreams, but I thought I had to do it for your spouse, so I said, "I left my work and <unk> and I went together to Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was getting into head in a physical <unk> and financial trap, carefully ready.
The next step in the middle of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how they react to.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that site where it was supposed to feel so safe to get three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept it underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived from a little bit.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never been lifted my hand, my life already was serious <unk> every minute of every day.
The first <unk> physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and he still had put the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend suit of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that they were happy to live forever, because I was loved and I loved it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of a family form with me.
It had been an isolated crash and never would have hurt.
I spent twice in our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach, and he <unk> me, and he gave me so strong in the head that <unk> various times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving off our honey moon, he was <unk> by the traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> followed <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was struck by when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of the three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying. At some point in his life, and the Centers for Disease Disease informs each year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So I actually had very good company.
So back to my question: Why would you tell me?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help <unk> to tackle their <unk>
The other question everybody else does is, why don't you just stop it?
Why didn't you care me, I could have gone at any time.
And to me, this is the saddest and painful question that people make people, because us, the victims, we know something that you normally have, is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the middle of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the killings in the middle of domestic violence occur after the victim ever <unk> to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions. include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marriage, <unk> of financial resources, and the family criminal system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not to stop the man who was beating his mother.
And yet we continue to ask why it simply doesn't go?
I was able to go to it, because of one last <unk> went up to my denial.
I realized that the man who I loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told it to the whole world to police, my neighbors, my friends and family and family and familiar unknowns, and I'm here today because all of you <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like headlines, women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people this is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the <unk> victims made a lot of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and that they would support their lives and happy lives and happily like <unk> wives and mothers -- completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor.
I was <unk> with a cute <unk> man and we have those three children.
I have this black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to do to you have never more, is a gun <unk> pointing my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
At this moment, you're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which is <unk> <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people that are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they are <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
The abuse it could be affecting their daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love, particular love, the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse is just silent.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They <unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their coworkers of work, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> that have a future future.
It <unk> the early signs of violence to intervene in consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe output of it.
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis of safe and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed this way.  fortunately I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothes on a <unk> scenario so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what I think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater for your head, because it's when you're going to laugh from me, so you don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this photo is.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed what I thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a <unk> in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would take my back and put the hair out of the kid.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial tan that I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our aspect, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white woman, and in my workforce, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do it, but it was <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> discovered, but it doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't just defined the beauty as health, both and symmetry, which we're biologically wired for <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> I've known to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> in the fashion that <unk> Stop. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing about models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told all of us and each of the models in the <unk> and from the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- is to say, less than four percent, they weren't white enough.
The next question that people can always ask me is: Can you be a model when it's <unk>
And my first response is, I don't know, I don't know that.
But then, what I would actually tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this <unk> <unk> still <unk> No, no, Cameron -- I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> chief of the American magazine or the next executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that more you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you are larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've finished your studies, and you have a copy and your back, no matter what you would expect, to say, if you <unk> that you want to be president of the United States, but your copy <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people will look like to look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yeah, virtually all the pictures, all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I got to myself, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time even in my period.
I know we're entering a personal field, but it was a child.
This is how he looked at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in the journal <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you will realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a professional group -- <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people can always do is to do things for free?
I have too much <unk> heels. I have never use, except the <unk> I get to have a couple of them in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to bring up money, and I was given the dress of free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and, of course, we got a red <unk> I'm sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges for me -- not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their matter no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year of the teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
But how many times do I <unk>
In researching this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the girls in 13 percent of the United States in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes up to 78 percent of the 17.
So, the last question that people ask you is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer to say is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll be very happy and beautiful.
And in behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we did it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative people, clever people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my view every day.
And if you ever ask, with some smaller legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs and the brightest <unk> and the nearest <unk> but probably the women are physically <unk> on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something that will retain out of this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception of the success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was enough enough to hold up a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more <unk> and I was not myself who <unk>
There was no <unk> no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a little care of the lighting in the lighting.
In fact, most of the <unk> <unk>
My story begins in the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That is the corner of <unk> and 5.
And he turns out that we went back to New York City a year later, so we decided to pull the same picture.
Well, you can see what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my daughter told me, why don't you take me to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we start to ask the tourists that were going to make us all the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown unknown camera is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, nobody has ever cracked with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change us.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that one day in the way that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop time in a week of October and make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That concrete time that we spent together is something that we hope with this whole year.
Recently in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the dolls store that would be small on the previous rooms.
And he described to me what had sense at five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at in New York are universities, because he's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls the picture.
Today, I want to encourage you all to show up in the picture, and I didn't go back to somebody and ask her, and he pulls us a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs <unk> as a dumb dumb characters.
More recently, if you've been following the printing press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because members of Parliament don't get clean the environment --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two kinds of <unk> on this planet.
There are the New World <unk> which are mostly in the <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the World Bank, where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 people face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> important? First of all, they provide healthy ecological services, <unk>
It's our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the monkeys to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria and help absorb anthrax than not to be for them, and it would cause great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have an enormous historical importance.
They've been associated with the ancient culture of culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and in Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they're doing some very important <unk> in places like Tibet, in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood for <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are on the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical list of endangered <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey of livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned by using veterinarian in India and they've taken a statement.
Since there are no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge <unk> of time to <unk> The number of cases of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. <unk> in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade trade trade, to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel around different countries, so you can focus on a locally locally it's not going to serve at all.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with the local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they <unk>
How can they help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, they will inform you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it flying without effort, no energy spending without <unk>
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do -- and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> but I'm not --  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia. In projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
I went to the 21, which the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything I would think about it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we got to seed <unk> in the south of Zambia in the south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach the local to grow cooked tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
And of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they were to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were amazed that the local citizens in so fertile valley, had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't know anything, we simply said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> in time to save the people from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a <unk> tomato <unk> to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it? "You're never <unk>
I thought that we just had the Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans were doing, what they did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
Let's see the <unk>  <unk> seeing the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just from two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if you were my children, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
So white women in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said about entire economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> on their own.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference and put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to give the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you've never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people in the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We got together in a cafe. We got together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, at once. But not in the community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell them in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what have they ever identified.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor in the company, the family doctor of the business, which is reported with you in your house, at the table in your kitchen table, and that helps it to find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this <unk> crap that we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came to me to say, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something really, really difficult.
And I got <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So what we've done in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of company.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now we're going to hear about reconstructing reconstructing <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you.
You have to offer them to offer us to privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you about this morning <unk>
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the spirit spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial industrial revolution that is <unk> fossils and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- the <unk> <unk>
The government?
It will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a particular story that in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year he came together -- this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not there within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve, and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> and so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> generic manufacturers <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very little <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. This Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you to <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to give you absolute -- absolute service <unk>
And then then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell a fantastic marketing and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, selling and looking for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 companies of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all new new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of it was started by one person.
I would never hear the word about it, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody begins a company alone. No one.
So then, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small environment in bars in bars in bars along with its dedicated quest to bars who are going to do for you, what somebody did for you, what somebody did about this <unk> someone who would ask you, what will you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> You can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do you share more memories from our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect on our needs to be able to reflect our needs.
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
There is a parade in New <unk> -- there's a fashion in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the greatest number of abandoned properties.
I live near this house, and I thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood, and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
Their death was all the sudden it was <unk>
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And it made me a profound gratitude for life and lived together.
It gave the meaningful things about my current life.
But let's try to keep this look in my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall from this giant house on a giant slate and he painted about her sentences for <unk> she had to die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I die of dying, I want to be <unk>  "Before I want to die I want to sit on the line of change <unk>
"Before she died, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die. I want to plant a <unk>
"Before she died, I want to live out of the <unk>
"Before she died, I want to give you one time more."
"Before she died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
"Before she died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me <unk> in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and <unk> and it's about giving the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we did a kit and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways of conserving the perspective and remember that life is short and sensitive life.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we are going to prepare for death is one of those things that were given more power.
And if you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters as individuals and as community and more media and more media to share the people around us not only to help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
Don't speak, but it gives you joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It shares what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter religious differences and notice about this: Never <unk>
When they sing early songs from our childhood, trying to tell the words that I couldn't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing that we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's a lot. It's very hot.
<unk> memory <unk>
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when each of the songs came out of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would be able to pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It's not <unk>
But most people don't agree with.
And in fact, because your minds do not fit into the concept of <unk> and they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even if you don't consider it inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing -- that they were <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a brain disorder that affects social media, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual each individual plays a different way from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developing disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When you spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It's a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
They were living and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars around the room, looking at the machine and eating anything that would have <unk>
As I was growing up, it got more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments in which I wish we were just like me.
But I look back at things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
The normal passes the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different does not mean you are wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and then Sam and you would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, it's autistic or not, the differences that <unk> is a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inner and, frankly, the search for normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and the change is dies at the time that we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me, a teacher of communications, who would give me a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  And I was afraid.
But in the 1990s, those conversations -- I felt what <unk> must have felt like when he fell through the hole in the <unk> and he saw the door of a new world.
Just so I sat down when I had those conversations with the students, they surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to environment and health care among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that we can see that their science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
You don't just tell us that we study the <unk> but study <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, caring with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that they make dumb stuff.
Instead, as Einstein said, which is everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
You can clearly communicate their science without compromise ideas.
One thing to consider it is to use examples, stories and analogies -- these are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have asked why they call <unk>  What do you do the <unk> the bullets are killed, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supported too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then give the graphs that we would contribute to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they were doing.
I think these are just some key ones that can help the others open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire Oxford English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor in the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for a public charge no matter or <unk> platform or principle, and that when <unk> gets it through the mere use of a monumental monumental one.
I have no idea what it means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the foundation of politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the word of the exact words that were told in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the unlikely name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
They put her on the Tower of London and he <unk> but he had enough courage to tackle them, and at the end of it had such a popular support in London to won.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk>
Most people think it's literally.
It's not. It's a <unk> advocate of speech.
But to actually show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to deal with the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> People in the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call him <unk>
They thought it was <unk> quality.
And they weren't even <unk> they had the idea that you could actually be elected King for a fixed party.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and I would always get <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King for if he did not give him or her designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate than it was done.
And that title was <unk>
President. Not invented the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious degree with an <unk> title and insignificant President of <unk>
And then finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't know.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep out there waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk> --  -- we may be able to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is most important, and with this -- I want to tell you about this is that the President of President of America doesn't sound very modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy in the world and a fleet of aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and history has endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell you that now are the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I'd like to give you to <unk>
politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control the reality, but really changes us change a lot more the words than what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to <unk> in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is warm and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and rocks <unk> with mechanical tools.
Like the others, I carry a flashlight of light <unk> supports his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of meters on the ground.
It <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost the control and dropped a hundred meters in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep at that hole at risking their lives without pay, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and went home, but they may never will, because they're prey of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the Summit of Peace <unk>
Among the amazing people I met there I met an <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was the world in the world, but not about the grade.
When we end up talking very sad, I was honestly <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during the entire deal of slaves <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, you can have entire families today by <unk> by <unk> by <unk>
Now amazingly, slavery generates profits from over <unk> 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they are forced to work without pay, under a threat of violence and they can't escape.
The slavery today operates in <unk> the goods produced by the slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable they're plants.
The slavery exists in most of the world and yet it's illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or <unk> <unk>
It <unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, in fact, entire families on a heavy, mechanically mechanically bricks in their heads up to 18 at the time and 18 at the same time, and they bring them from the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no breaks to eat, nor to drink, and severe <unk> I would make it rather <unk>
So <unk> they were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch it, and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment that these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry on it, but the <unk> who was on my side and said to me, <unk> you don't get it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me so clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his liberation and he trusted the way it <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying rocks for miles for <unk> land to trucks that they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who charge them and the children would send them to their heads with straps <unk> made from clubs, ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and work 16 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be hard to me to work with safety in this particular business.
In <unk> I was inspired by women who had previously been previously <unk>
They drove me on a few ladders stairs that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known in the craft, they are local.
They have small rooms, private rooms, where they <unk> them with their girls and kids, and some of them just seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number <unk> on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of a <unk> <unk> fear and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they <unk>
No doors <unk>
There were no windows big enough to <unk>
These people don't have <unk> and, since we played a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people sitting in agriculture, in <unk> in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 Americans are sold every year as sex love.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often relate to the labor hand.
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families in the trade of silk families.
This is a family.
The black hands of black hands are the father, the blue <unk> of her children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me the stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope, yet, to be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children <unk> in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older kids, some more young children, some more young kids, makes sense right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families -- <unk> <unk> and they forced to work wide <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy has eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of branches of the <unk> trees in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and <unk> to the water to unleash the branches.
A lot of them will be <unk>
Since remember, it has always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of her love not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the younger slaves under their command.
And I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the other.
On the cold night and we <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike. he suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and touched our window.
He asked us to do it by a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we were invited to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out fast.
And then I signal this path as much visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we took the <unk> and then to walk around an hour -- we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I put it in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up in an end, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up to their backs and, while they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a <unk> in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the <unk> they were <unk> on their own sweat.
I remember looked at his eyes tired, <unk> given that many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have to be 90 feet away, and these people carry heavy stone bags that will then be transported to another area where they <unk> the stone to extract the gold.
At the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer at the margin and you see others less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> by <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died, he took him to work with him at mines.
When he died his uncle, <unk> I did inherit the debt of the uncle to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked on mines 14 and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and yet that, is forced to work night and day in that mine.
And yet, he dream to be released and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, from face to a remote possibility -- what inspires me a lot respect.
I want to shine light on the slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we could find testimony of them and that we will do everything we can to help change their lives.
I really think that if we can see ourselves each other as human beings, then it makes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. These are people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I am going to think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images are actually starting a force in people who see them in people like you, and I hope that force turns out a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I'm doing applied mathematics -- and there is a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like management channels.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk>   that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demand is a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> <unk> that may well have a genetic component.
Sadly, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a virtuous dancer dance.
Over the last few years has made a lot of progress on treatment.
But there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way and, ultimately, the only way we know if there really is a cure that we will be when we have an objective building and <unk>
But it's so frustrating that for Parkinson's disease and other disorders of the movement, there are no biological <unk> so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological exam test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of clinical trials, you never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could make ourselves?
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars on the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do, as a kind of no conventional form of a try, you see, in a certain sense at least we are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the elastic ropes.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds to speak. Can we imagine as a dancers of a vocal ballet <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of the genes that we need to do is have the <unk> for example.
And as they did it, it requires a level of extraordinary training.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learning to talk.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as they <unk> and as Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects <unk>
At the bottom line you can see an example of <unk> irregular strings <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
They both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> exams.
I mean, you can be <unk>
They make very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're at the minimum cost and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears on a mass scale.
These are some amazing lists for <unk>
We can reduce our patients.
You wouldn't have to go to the clinic for a pregnancy <unk>
With high-speed monitoring we could get data goals.
We could make this massive massive cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when I give you today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk> Initiative.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no Parkinson's disease, it can call under price and leaving recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will you come from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the so-called <unk> you have to indicate if you have to be or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people can not afford it. You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data that's going to look at different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in pursuit of the actual markers of disease.
TR: You have a precision <unk> at this point?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> it has done fantastic work and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone grid, as well, what we would think of the project. Now it's 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, it was <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're very gray creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, in no windows and so large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the new models even more <unk> the perfect skin -- the perfect skin -- we do the impossible and focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after, an organization where it was <unk> there was <unk> <unk> was in the room working as part of the team of response.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay in the house, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village on the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level took over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers into land.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
And the rubble of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and we leave them ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons and tons of fish dead, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
And for weeks, both volunteers as the neighbors were found by similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of the peoples around them to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk> the people.
It helped clean bathrooms -- the enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place in the village where the <unk> center <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor of them and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went beyond myself my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had over a hundred years, some still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl must be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl wouldn't have the appearance of it, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the step of time, they got a lot more photos and they got more <unk> so that I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 days later 80 people was offered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people <unk> <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were inspired by <unk> a neighbor town north of <unk>
Once the week we used our scanner in the libraries of temporal agencies that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on of course <unk> of the photos.
It could involve an hour. I could take a weeks.
I could take months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures long in seawater, covered of bacteria, with algae, and even with oil, all of that together with the time I spent my time -- I'm going, <unk> was a major part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the picture at least he was clean -- dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky at hand.
We have the guidance of <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make any mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was really lucky in relation to the photos.
And he had begun to <unk> her himself but stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face would not have been <unk> we were able to grab the images in a single picture and take the whole picture.
When they collected their photographs shared some of their story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures in a station station between the rubble too far from where he used to be his house, but their colleagues were <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Her children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
It took a week to find his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his photos his son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could look at, something that could remember the past that was not marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
And after six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, and hundreds of them had joined there, and hundreds of them were helped to clean hand out of <unk> the great <unk> -- the great majority became the hands of their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 percent and hundreds of pictures of totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend over <unk> in teams and materials, most on ink for <unk>
We take pictures of each time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, somebody loved.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would get to you, but the first thing you would think about looking for.
So this was the project of restore small pieces of mankind, to bring someone away from the past.
When a picture like this one comes back to someone, it is a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a great difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected it with something bigger -- to get something, using their talent for something that won't be perfect skin models.
To finish this email I'd like to read this electronic email that I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and shown the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women from different ages from grandmother to a small child, gathering around a baby, and I was shocked, because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, I and my daughter just hangs off our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the same.
Thank you.
<unk> inspired inspired and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that's going through an apple on an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique of rapid technique that can make videos of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenge the camera thing.
If I take a laser pointer and you switch it on and you put it into a <unk> or so, in a second way, to create a <unk> pack of <unk> just a millimeter big.
And that pack of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If we take that bullet and this pile of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the <unk> of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light movement.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a pack of photons that starts to <unk> and inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights in the top of the top you look at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we make it go down the same distance and see it in slow to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? It's actually a week?
It would be a very boring film -- of a slow bullet in motion.
And what about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato and the bottom wall.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I was thinking, like, a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition.
But if you look at more and more of this tomato -- you'll notice that, as the light comes out of the tomato <unk> follows bright. Don't get <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside it and it gets out after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket, check if fruit is grown without having to be <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture of it in the lower exposure, and it comes in very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the simplest light hits you, so I just get some light.
So we sent that <unk> that pack of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and <unk> them to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in the raw data and make it really interesting.
Superman can be able to fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of the future is allowed him to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. I get into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, there.
Where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, at a slightly different time.
And as we have a camera that works like this quickly, our <unk> has unique capabilities alone.
It has very good resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances down to the door and also the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point is going away.
When I project a laser you can record a laser picture, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the <unk> object.
Can we look at <unk>
This is our reconstruction of it.
We have things to explore before we take this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions with what's going on the curve, on the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking by the light reflected by the open windows by the computer.
Or could we build <unk> capable of seeing the inside of the body by having <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is really hard, so this is actually a request to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new modality of visualization to solve the problems of mammography in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, he turned science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
And I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected is not just for scientific <unk> but we can see that we can do.
We create a new form of computer photograph with slow and color codes.
And look at those ripples remember, the time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going out of us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have terrible effects.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes appears to go through the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can make your life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, it can be a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you can record it and get famous.
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who would have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your cell <unk>
<unk> A Android, wow!
That's a lot. Almost everyone has a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 percent lines of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This board says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends the email to who.
Who sends you a text to who.
And if we use mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in his phone company or his Internet provider or the Internet.
And all across Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone to have the phone providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were <unk> journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the Berlin streets in Berlin and they said, <unk> don't <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who then was the largest telephone company in Germany, which for me to give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to wonder, and I didn't get a concrete response. It was all blah.
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, he agreed.
And they would send me the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly little on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand and five billion people, 30 lines of information.
I first saw it and I said, well, it's a huge archive.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, "I want this information to happen.
I want to make it <unk>
Because I want to show people what the <unk> means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open came City, we did this.
This is a visualization for six months of my life.
You can zoom in and down, go backwards and go ahead.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> on the train to <unk> and what often I call on the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what's doing the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks with whom, who send you an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people on the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, having a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today at day today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to keep them in forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go back home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value.
When you go home to go home to their representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company, what information is <unk>
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remind them that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I went back to my mom six times in six different different directions to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It's only about accidents, like the one that came up at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of them to be there.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to become disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas <unk> they're in the shopping center, driving in search for parking lot and what you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and P. C is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm in Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial initial run.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, you can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe when you don't can."
The mantra of my father was, "Can you help me -- <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters, older <unk>
If my three sisters were going to public school, my parents were going to come to public school, and I was also <unk> that I were also out there, and if we didn't take it all the top grade, all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five to the five years to put my <unk> into his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I would do it.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and so on.
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten was walking like a boxer champion who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there's 20 Arabic -- and they continue to be all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a slogan of campaign.
The people I grew up with no trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed <unk> a lot of hunger die during the <unk>
I would tell them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating them, so you go from the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I do too.
And when my friends were going to go through summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were worried that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get into <unk>
On my summer vacation was often my father trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> I would drink warm cups in the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a <unk> comedian that I could not stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can hold it in your head.
My parents would take this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the public discrimination and I got a fellowship for the University of Arizona, the University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the <unk> department.
And I all got <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the highest note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo of glass my teachers.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started shouting at the four <unk>
I've got <unk>
At the end of it. At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater, crying crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, and asking why and she said to me because they believed that I could not make the stunt stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and they gave it to an actor without brain <unk>
I was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors who are <unk> actors for disabled papers.
And I went back home, and my first tour tour was as an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> of <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see myself more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the directors of <unk> not <unk> actors, <unk> <unk> with disabilities.
Just please perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
And in my first tour he took comic comics on New York to New Jersey to New York to New Jersey, and I never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he fell at high speed at the highway of New Jersey with a driver that had <unk>
I worked in <unk> across the United States, and also in Arabic in Arabic, without <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know they never heard that little horrible rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find really fun.
In 2003, my brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind the CEOs of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier to fight against the challenge of stigma about disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was a <unk> to the cable news program, it has back with Keith <unk>
I walked out to a graduation dance, I went back to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the <unk> and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I went on to the desktop of the speaker to not go through the screen during the <unk> and when the interview, was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't go back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I was just like I got full time <unk> and I hit my chair.
One thing that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but it never got me off of me and no more girl and no older girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I had video clips online -- like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite guy, <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The disability is so visual, like race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't make it <unk> then you can't do it -- you can't make someone in <unk>
<unk> are the -- Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with the media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still use the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was a representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children Palestinians to Palestinians a tiniest little bit of what my parents would give to me.
It was the only time my father saw me acting live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and on the edge of <unk>
Nothing for him there, is going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities -- there are no work, or <unk>
He's just living in a tent, in the city outside of <unk>
So after maybe a year ago, you know.
One day you get about a guy who offers this to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
She meets a dynamic group of people, which gives him a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new money to send home to your family.
They present to a young guy.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a bomb car.
That little boy in that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little boy trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for the future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that was stuck.
This was the first thing that took him from what we call "the <unk> <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed young people that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for work, of work, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who are suffering from higher rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give us opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terror, to terror, to violence, to be the story of 2.0 cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not going to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital <unk> the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support the juveniles in a business level.
<unk> to some 90 juveniles <unk>
We sat and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
I had no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, because he was a college graduate student, frustrated, frustrated, was the perfect white man for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
He started a company <unk>
They started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who normally couldn't <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is it different this story?
What does this <unk>
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative to do.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came there, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the overseas.
If you give someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for weddings, creating gardens in the houses, and the companies of the city, and now he's working on the creation of the world's first <unk> public park in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where families, the young people, they can go together, and like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but his story, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
We encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people to create a culture of business that is really a big step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas come true.
They need experience and orientation to make it in development and set up in the way of their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create an <unk> to urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed isn't simply selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope.
His Park Park -- that's how we call it when they are created, it will transform the way people see their city.
I <unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
They gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the <unk> of <unk>
These young people are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, and you eat their innovation, they will have more stories about flowers and Parks than <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in northern New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the way that we were going to do, we almost could pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed of view of a beautiful <unk> Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- balls of paper <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to clean their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how they <unk> or where you do -- the <unk> who cleans our crap in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> cleans our trash, and about 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products, every day.
I wanted to meet them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who doing that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked out of his pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more <unk>
So I started working on how we trash crap.
Now I wasn't just going to travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody wonders about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and in the days that it's very strong one is going to be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept keeping the weight of taking over their body tons every day.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of nations, <unk> the collection of waste is one of the world's most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving in the traffic all the day and pass it back around you.
They just want to kill you, so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And the crap also itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the crap is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It always has to be moving.
And there's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think it's strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important labor hand in the city streets for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the efficient and effective shape every day, this starts to <unk> their <unk> and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
So we had controlled for decades and centuries they come back and start to <unk>
The economy needs the economy.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have room for what the motors in the economy start to fail when it's endangered the consumption of the economy.
I'm not advocating by capitalism, I just put on the relationship.
And then what I call our average speed is necessary.
What I mean is just at the speed that we used to move in the <unk> period.
We usually don't have <unk> we didn't get <unk> or we took with us our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use it, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that would take out of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the garbage collection that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day in a <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
Do you know when you look at it?
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us away from ourselves, from our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow should always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> truck on the street, grabbed my little son, I went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing this particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that I started looking at waste collection and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
<unk> <unk> what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean the crap of you, you will get a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the actual work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the Addis Ababa Addis Lab <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out there?
And after seeing some of these buildings there are many of the city in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the lining of crystals generates heat inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it comes to a change that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, what his looks look like to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a global building, from several stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced by exploring the website, which is located in a very long area of the city, where much of the buildings we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in a hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs from the building.
And this is happening with a <unk> atrium, that creates a space in the open air in the building that was <unk> by its own shape, in the sun and rain.
And around this space, we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every ground because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be attached to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete shell.
We then inspire us in these beautiful buttons in the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center. It was not what they <unk>
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center, because at the end of the bank that had more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air <unk>
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, that we set up collect water for the <unk>
So it's waiting for the early next year, since we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project, so big the biggest project, which I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put attention on the <unk> a structure of 1,000 years ago that was surrounded by a wall with 12 gates of connecting connected lines.
When I went to place, the first operation of design that we did was <unk> the existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks in size and characteristics that there is in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some more strategic spots in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a heat difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections for pedestrians.
And they also respond to local norms that set up a higher density at higher levels and lower density into the plant floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the busy space of construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and get them together and make activities such as a race for two kilometers in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes communities and local economies at the same rate of buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but we think they improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as an objective to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had great piles of very bright hair and a little <unk> of pencils and <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I finished that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the school, I was a little afternoon, and I hid in the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took off the table of my masters school <unk>
And then, I did.
I took the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some Like this.
All the way --  And I set up to bring back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
And so in a <unk> we would take the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put in every rows of <unk> and I just got a row out of it, just because they were there.
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never tell you.
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I would never get back.
But above all, I was telling me the reason why I was bothered with this little girl to be so small for <unk>
I was overwhelmed by jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
The birds tiles are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet I have never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab that we study <unk> in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no pain, <unk> it would have also been literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There was no king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
I wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I looked at a high high high school lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy there's no <unk> I know that it is fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the Amazonas, most of them have them.
This year is going to be 100 years of his work <unk> "In the <unk> <unk> study -- and also the ordinary <unk> -- mine, mine, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard that image is.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how <unk> <unk> but we assume it is <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious how the serves that are reduced to person, to their <unk> are a good narrative foundation <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel familiar, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being the storytellers and audience -- we know exactly what details <unk> to <unk> the knife, right?
<unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understood understood.
Everything that she does so give me pleasure to another time right now.
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion.
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> I like the big piles of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links the language of nature with jealousy.
When <unk> is in its chest pain, suddenly listening behind the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then ours those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's <unk> scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> you see <unk> and they make it seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, to search of the truth, a very painful. In fact, what you can do, <unk> the more painful of the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> are the <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs us -- that makes us suffer, it causes us to a whole range of feelings more profound and vital man than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal us to ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way?
Is there any other emotion we had our <unk> our <unk> ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud went to a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that his wife was going to.
And Freud says there was a strange thing in that man, who doesn't bother what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing that, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how <unk> make us look at intensity but accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we become the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are bringing us to do violent and illegal.
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years old -- but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook since he was sending terrible messages to itself, for a year.
For a year every year.
She was trying to bring it to the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I was with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big though it comes to creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are trying to deal with how the serves <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of function, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting to be what you have to take out of your own self and get it out of what you've ever got to do, and it's under the ground <unk> to your name, it takes your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world as much as sometimes I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what characters are always doing when you're not sure, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about Professor <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius did.
But I always have to say, <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> face of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it would be <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually it starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of Six <unk> once <unk> <unk> to all of his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> that I don't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems to me this very emotional -- that scene also is mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem with no emotion.
You know, in a minute, it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute are the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
It's just <unk> fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> invites me to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the terrifying thing that Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> column of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
<unk> and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the greatest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a few people a 400,000 people and asked 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People died people, including the Apollo crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, which he swam after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't brought a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that was 24 percent later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The <unk> answer is that they were because the president Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. Some people ask, why is the <unk>
Why do we turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why do you scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why fly over the <unk>
Why does Rice play <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo <unk> was not just a victory of the West about the east in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the technologies of technology.
They were because it was great power to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship, but in 1969, the <unk> crew crew flew to 40,000 miles per hour.
From 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful joyful story about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seems to be able to have a result.
I remember <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we don't <unk> the <unk> tube <unk> of the rocket that Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So that's what it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like what if the technologists had been distracted and had enriched toys with trivial, things like <unk> and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the selling <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't enact the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years when they were <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says the markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offered to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused that the creation of ideas has been <unk> the creation of ideas <unk> by <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at its high point without caring for the risk, they preferred investment investment, small investment minute than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with profit in technologies like energy, which need a huge amount of capital and which development is long-term capital, they have never invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we can go to Mars if you are."
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going on Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that's never going to happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from energy sources, like solar power, wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy sources that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, of entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties development -- development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seem technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for long time that famines are result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis to affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and <unk> of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes going to make a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
The president Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some <unk> <unk> to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have -- but these four elements have been <unk> political leaders, and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must be able to support <unk> it must really be a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous thing, and there's not a popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, we go to the moon it turned out to be straightforward.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have any <unk> problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about the trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that are about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a <unk> we should have more confidence.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover the confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And he bow to me to think that there may be dropped down into some activities or institutions and that could be augmented in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can look at surveys of view, and surveys of opinion are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at surveys of opinion over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> about 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they still remain quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average average of the street is almost just half the way.
But this is enough?
What the studies of opinion polls are, of course, opinion.
What else can you get?
What you're looking at is the <unk> attitudes that people play when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody said to you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I'm probably going to ask for asking, "What do you do?
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust you, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel by a certain kind of official <unk> or a person -- it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for instance, say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the class, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we end all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk>
I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the real confidence of real trust, because they try to raise the good judgment of inherent in something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I wish to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
In short, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who would take their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think in them, I think, well, yes, it was too <unk>
Having more trust is not a intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> or <unk> in intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it, he says, yes, that means that what it matters in the first place is not the trust, but the trustworthiness.
What it's about is to make a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if, on the contrary, it's not that we could not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest and <unk> but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure they can make certain things, but I see it <unk> your own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have many friends who are <unk> and responsible and extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't got myself wrong.
But that's what we're going to do before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we've been trying to build <unk> systems for all kinds of institutions, professional people, officials and others, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said to me, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> you go to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we understand that the accountability of accountability which is destined to guarantee the <unk> and evidence of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I mean, you all know similar examples.
So let's take all of that, for the goal.
I believe that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we are going to be worthy of trust and <unk> to people who are reliable and if we are trying to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> what it doesn't do <unk>
Third, the task.
Let's go to the task of rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But the trust, ultimately, it is defining because they give us some other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You've got to give you the bases enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to bring some systematic evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do you do it?
That happens to a day, everywhere, the common people, the common people, the <unk> the institutions very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks up, it says I can give you no explanations for you.
I take them and bring it back to me money, or change it for the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not something very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be taught.
This separation has gone increasingly becoming more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
So I first created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen screen its physical body into the pixel itself.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool -- the barriers.
But the two hands remain still on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the <unk> division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital digital field.
It would be a transparent Norden bombsight to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside the 3D space, and get out of pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and you can highlight lines or words with the online touch sensor, which is below every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
So in these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and moved things through the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make it physical as we can make it <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, this only physical pixel.
This magnet, <unk> it acts like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and <unk> and they are always in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> physically and distance -- and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the <unk> of planets, physics, and, unlike <unk> or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to have <unk> from our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only threshold that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I became <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk> years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they believed firmly that there was just an effective way to the <unk> a safe job and <unk> work.
No matter what I would like or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera, man.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer had to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote the director of the school and the speaker of a radio show.
But no adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were wrong, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
And I would argue that during the rest of my life a second class was the only thing that could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to find another <unk>
No one in my head, I wanted to make it <unk> OK.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> comes from life <unk>
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange <unk>
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told myself, "It's so different, and so much better than it <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt trap. and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture that was also place to my <unk>
It takes a lot of perspectives.
For example, at first this map this map seemed to me because this is what students are in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are to fields of research like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers <unk> a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was working for research, why not do it as well in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic, political and <unk>
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and duty for <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's really fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> path of <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized in Chinese -- literally, means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connecting with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used to feel like that.
Having a broken dream, it's really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I have come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that I dreams of where the dreams come from, where the passion comes from.
A broken dream can do that for you.
And it is because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> encountered a <unk> and he threw up on the couch of my office and told me that I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> became easy just to move the head while I was going to make the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and so I looked at her was right.
You start to work after that, you get home later, it has children later, to death later.
In the <unk> as Alex and I had plenty of go.
But shortly after, my squad <unk> pushed me to press Alex that I would talk about his life <unk>
I would get <unk>
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys underneath his category, it was <unk> with a head <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it's <unk> with the next.
Also, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yeah, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't mean that the <unk> of Alex were a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were looking at it.
And so I realized that this kind of recklessness <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future <unk> all over the place.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think nobody gets to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh yeah. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the sleep -- a <unk> I want to see. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years old.
This means eight of every 10 and experiences and moments that make a way to your life have happened to be when they have 30 and <unk>
People in the 40, people are not trained to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and it was <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change yourself, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility goes to its top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time to get it on their body and their options.
When we think about the developing child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday everyday life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of time <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> marriage.
The journalists asked him names, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and it was absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, smart, smart, interesting <unk> like you or your kids get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't really own. I'm just killing the time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts sound like this: "My <unk> are by <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game play.
They were all running around and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it crashed the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit true, but you don't know the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure to the <unk> and so many of you started a city, choosing a couple, and have two or three children in a long period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once to the <unk>
The middle of the middle age crisis, it's not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You know, you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was you doing?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having a crisis of identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, I was living with a boyfriend, which was showing more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living in a very hard time, his previous life had been even more difficult.
And so much in our <unk> but then she would wake up to say, "You don't pick your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, she got her head on his legs and cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words that followed after the <unk> in case <unk> please call <unk>
He was about the <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who's going to be for me if I have a crash accident.
Who is going to take care of me if you give me up.
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist and don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which is really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit as the decade of Emma went on front.
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who was <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> of identity.
And by identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity generates capital of identity.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> the exploration of exploration is <unk> exploration that should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited to who you know, what you know, how they talk, how they talk, and where they work.
That new capital piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from the nearest <unk>
The new things come from what they call weak ties friends of friends.
Yeah, half the <unk> have a bad job or don't have a job.
But the other half no, and the weak ties are the way we get to this group.
The half of the jobs that I created will never be <unk> then to know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not released.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't pick his family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but it was like, Emma soon <unk> his family when she has a partner and it exists his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think the 30 is better enough to sit head or even the 25 or even the 25 and I agree with you.
But pick the person to the person you live right now, or have you <unk> now when all on Facebook start walking towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before they have, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just to make it work or kill time with whoever you are to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> son of a cousin who worked at an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That labor supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with which he alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send myself a letter that said, "Now the emergency spaces of emergency room are not stupid enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to support them.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, coming out somewhere in the <unk>
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, in the 21st or the 25 to the 25 or the <unk> a good conversation, a good time, a good TED talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the people who have heard of.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I have the privilege of telling the <unk> and the <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their <unk> get their <unk> use their weak links, pick your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them math to students in seventh grade schools.
And as any professor, I made tests and tests.
I give you tasks.
When I work back, I will go back grades.
What struck me was that <unk> wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance, they had no <unk> scores of I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure how to measure it.
It's the <unk> but what if you have success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn <unk> and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to university to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to do in the competition.
We studied very difficult teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and the <unk> who will be the most effective thing to improve the outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking yourself, which of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all of these very different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important success of success.
And it was not social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did <unk> and then waited for more than a year to see who they <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly higher likely to <unk> even when they were able to measure, things like their family income, the results of evidence -- even the security of the tests, the evidence that kids felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> National <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know what science knows about its development.
Every day, parents ask me, "How do we development in children?
What should I do to teach kids a strong ethic.
How do I keep them with the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, unnecessary determination is not related or even related to the measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to see.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start to start with all the new lessons with the lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> <unk> is my <unk> <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters form.
From that moment, I was struck by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can get down this <unk> so that anyone who is to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read traffic traffic signals, they will understand the basic idea of the web web or the paper.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you can even be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person in both the both like I was screaming like I was shouting at <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> the way it's called, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of gates of an old West <unk>
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old saying, two are company, three are a crowd.
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a prisoner's as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  -- you know, a <unk> tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two looks together, it becomes very hot.
Three <unk> that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a board inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> <unk> there's someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each small effort, they'll be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So one sun along the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
One Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked together, one on the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be a dad is the movies I get to see.
I love sharing my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz magician combined.
The film <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand, to wear a magic.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of a <unk> industrial success show.
However, the Oz magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took the rise to 40 years later on, with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a little metal boy and a guy named <unk> <unk> to a girl in her <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the Oz magician is doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the world they had the bad <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing in the Oz is that the most wise characters and wise characters are women.
I began to notice this when I made Star Trek to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Three years old.
I wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  And so slid in the room and he was impressed like a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but I didn't think he would understand everything.
I wonder what it was about?
Would you be <unk> and resilience and <unk>
I should feel that Luke one to an army to <unk> the government?
So let's do this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you make Dorothy film?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, okay? And not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why are there so much toxic capital muscle force in movies for our kids, and so little on the road of bricks and <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know that the princess <unk> it doesn't give me the right framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss I really expected the feet to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, if you're a girl, you have to wear a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and I will stand up to Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they guys, they're not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job when teaching girls how they fight against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend their <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who are writing new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all times continues on classic classic by classic <unk> each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, two men who are raising a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism was when he came out.
I can't believe that I can't believe that it's made a movie of a <unk>
It's really good. Don't let that get the <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> the root and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of <unk> movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the boy than the <unk>  All right? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women that exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk> movie.
Right? <unk> <unk> success of <unk> a sense of consensus from what is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> no test <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis."
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 more popular movies -- how many of them believe they have protagonists of them.
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he was.
One in the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually sexually <unk>
I don't think it's a mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that item, one of the things I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they not achieve <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to take it out.
We have tools to our disposal like <unk> <unk> and we hope that we would have to ask you, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> if at the same time, it activates or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our children males a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is radically changing radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite Star character is, you know what he was.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories to tell my <unk> Go and fight alone and more stories where she looked at their work is to join a team -- maybe a team led to women, helping other people better and better people, like the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look for fortune cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would get to <unk>
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length along the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we can see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the Eastern Delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in plain sight, seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process using <unk> using <unk> and suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old <unk> city called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for more than 400 years in a period of time called the Middle <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, and architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk>
This area is enormous, it measures about <unk> per mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, and it covered the whole city.
So how do you find a <unk> city on a <unk> landscape.
And I find random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data from NASA to make a map, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where it was going to be <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly high that you see inside the circle here, we think it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs can you see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of shown in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, looking for layers of human occupation looking for layers of <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> layer of several hundred years to date from the Middle East, exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like not a lot, but when we think about the most common rocks used in the jewelry in the Middle East, these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a shop mining shop which proves that what I've been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but let's take place in the near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians on the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Roman Roman <unk> was probably written in <unk> four years ago.
<unk> knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So apparently TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas really happen in 1984 B.C. B.C. in a lost city not for much time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the search <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door <unk>
I'd like to pay you attention to the color of the gate, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a <unk> group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing with a bicycle <unk> and they go in front of their door to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bikes flying around everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> the line.
The <unk> to the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of light -- light shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with her hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that we talk about.
You can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you go to get in my mouth.
They slept on one side and enter your living room.
Already in the room, and I use peak of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with time with little clothing, dancing over their center, singing <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's look at the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a very yellow bricks and from the oven come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> you look at them once.
So we had the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
<unk> whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who I could memorize more quickly, the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be <unk>
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best memories <unk>
I asked him, <unk> when you realize you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
And we were trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old memory acts in Greece, the same techniques that used to <unk> to memorize their speeches and that medieval <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, "Can I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English English -- he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of film cards in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
It ended up spending the majority of the year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how far our memory makes us we are.
At the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, a lot of treaties about memory written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory was not such a rare thing as it can seem like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed, and I would argue that they have changed cognitive lives.
As much as we have no need to remember, sometimes it seems to be we forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined memory and <unk> memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, an researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some ways, structural structural or different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive battery, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting and meaningful difference between brains of memory champions and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them into a MRI machine, <unk> your brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or they looked like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for competitive <unk> is driven as a armed race in where each year, someone has a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
At his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of film <unk> that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was just <unk>
He used a very similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
Within a half an hour. Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all techniques used at the end of the end to a single concept that psychologists call <unk>
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says this: I tell two people to remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word that I told you about a <unk>
So what do you want?
The person who told him that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything to you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories you dance for your head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
It's good when they come back home to work.
Probably some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says, there was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if they wanted to give a very good party, they wouldn't put a <unk> he was <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, he was standing up with his memory poem, and it was <unk> and so soon it was, the hall of <unk> <unk>
They were going to get all of us.
But not only killed them all of them, but it shattered the bodies that are <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
I stopped standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with your eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting next to me.
I took the <unk> <unk> <unk> where his loved ones were in the rubble.
What you see -- <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering the name or the phone numbers or the word <unk> or the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and space <unk>
If you ask you, the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to make it very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask you to tell you who I was sitting on the horse sign in your lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory was to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, the most <unk> self.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory, the same way that they would have done it -- if you'd invited it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous ridiculous, crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing they want to mention is that <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then they would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk would be that strange journey that they made for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> your narratives -- not word for word that is going to confuse you, typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw that this was just just fascinating, and I stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensively about this <unk> of <unk> competitive.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in your place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sit up to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I would never expect it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is better and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty upset with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some safety posts covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that it had covered a year before. He had the idea that it could be made in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just <unk>
Because they're based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be building <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on it deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing kind of processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of us are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things are done <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what you would think of the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that it had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks on our side -- we will be so <unk> that we don't even get to process <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so it <unk> just a <unk> <unk>
Because about 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at home my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everybody was watching the television TV, so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everyone was looking at me, and every time I got married, and I got wrapped up in a towel -- all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and <unk>
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of those connections that are emotional <unk> emotional connections that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So, 90 percent of time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you about, think of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it for based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that use the architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, far from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and the governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, it has a <unk> has this round thing -- columns, three, red brick -- that <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, came up with another library that looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, to read and to share.
So how is it possible for the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, be so different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects that constantly drives new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's life.
We were going to give it to us and we were just <unk> so we get away from the people.
Every black, this is what you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and go back with these symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, and so we started to experiment like <unk> So we started to swing the <unk> back to go ahead, over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago from the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really really hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
Let's take the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> out of glass.
The shapes became <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or in Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, new memories of other places.
I know that this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques, and we find new <unk> a lot of ways that we would behave against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Typically, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> academic and general audiences were completely aware of a building.
New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction.
<unk> in Bilbao grew up for a half percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, <unk> Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Einstein was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how it's possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms states and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They did the main mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium, I went with other different technologies.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, that it actually started to go through all architecture, digital media started to increase the energy consumption rate.
Think for example, how do you use architecture.
thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we are all photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast, so fast.
It doesn't make a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I know if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen. Because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture since the invention of the <unk> of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the <unk> the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it's going to be on both extremes almost in <unk> and it is actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that is <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly at the product done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that you made the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes you engage with our collective memory, and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but that has changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded bombarded with examples of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell you that there are no unique response to what a library might be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complex drawings and one is no longer a <unk> audience, who doesn't accept something that I haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get <unk> by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the extent of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick on ideas of what it should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally are ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings will be transferred to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, also can serve to make a spectator or to <unk> or even one can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> of New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community tied around that cause, is not a customer alone.
It means no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we've built.
The architects already know how to make buildings more and more friendly.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite direction.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it way to the more <unk> spaces, the local libraries of households where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned to a year and started walking.
And it does this very cool way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it. When I want to do that?
How is it all of a sudden we're not really comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And like any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little confused because, it's a little confused because, although his mom tells him all the time she is beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it is ugly.
Among what your mom tells him and what his friends, or classmates are people in school they say, don't know who they believe.
So a video ago, she publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy and ordinary teenager, which gets these answers in one of the stages of their more vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, teenagers are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected, so I was so young, so young <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, to be always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of liking that they have and the kinds of reviews that they do.
There's no divide between one life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's true or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what it is been rigged about it.
What is the furthest in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a everyday context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from girls now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are comparing to.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like those of the superheroes <unk> and the singers were born.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we sure surely we want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals <unk>
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and effort to look at their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and others begin to suffer.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings and how to taxpayers society and the developing field.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class.
One in five are not attending to classes at all the days when you're not comfortable on it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think that you look at good enough if you don't think you're good enough -- you give a note lower note to the average of your companions who don't care about what looks like.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China, and China.
And it becomes irrespective of what these young people actually weigh these young.
So, to make good of course, we're talking about how you see you not how you get it.
The <unk> on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with times less physical activity, eat less fruit and vegetables, they are involved in more diet that they can bring them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this for what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and drug consumption and drugs, strategic surgery, aesthetics, sexual <unk> relations to earlier ages and <unk> <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether or don't have higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in one day where they don't feel safe in the way you can see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes -- the first one is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs, without realizing it, the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that follow our children not only have a positive impact, but also <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas -- the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be crucial to anyone willing to provide education in body self-esteem than work.
An education is fundamental -- but to deal with this problem requires each of us that take the reins in the subject and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
So challenging status today as women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as you can see.
All of us can start doing this, assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can give people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and as companies, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing their whole person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people that are actually making the difference in a <unk>
I make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never seen, of being the ones that are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean.
Who do you have in mind?
They <unk>
They <unk>
They <unk>
He <unk> her <unk>
It could be just the woman who is two seats away from what it would mean for her if it was liberated from that voice <unk> in his interior, which he would tell him for not having long legs -- <unk> <unk> a smaller belly <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would say that we can unlock the potential that way?
Right now, the obsession with our culture with images is attached to us.
But let's give our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and so they do, and because they make us feel.
They gave the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we took together as a community from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today's age are becoming agents of insurance change in themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
Last November of November 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi <unk> <unk> the author of the League Defense League leader.
It was initially sure enough, but being prisoner by other <unk> charges in the company of others, started planning attacks at about 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations <unk>
So luckily, those plans were <unk> by an FBI of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't escape it.
Later on, it would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with an American mother, high school high school high school <unk> between the two did all the way to give me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims get to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get to want the same things in life.
But in all of religion, in all human group, all human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are going to be so <unk> to their convictions who thinks we need to use all of the possible means for everybody to live as them.
A few months before the arrest was he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to shoot in Long Island to practice.
He said I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained how to aim for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot -- I gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise everybody, especially mine, all the goal in flames.
My uncle came back to each other and Arabic, he said <unk>
As a parent, as a child.
All of all, the comment was a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they found as funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to place a van with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking system of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times, I had moved 20 times, that instability during my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone was already time to pack and go to another city.
Because it was always me the new face of the class often was <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white, but being the new class of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons not developed social skills, so to say <unk> for <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was fascinated with, opera, by judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put together my way to think was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program that I participated in the <unk> National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> at the theme of the juvenile violence as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the guys we had ever done, was Jewish people.
It took several days to go out of the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend before, and I was quite proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been made up to me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush -- a park of <unk>
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience turned out to be critical in the development of my character.
All of life had been taught that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By a chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the smartest and less critical critics I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what is going to be trial for something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be honest about my <unk> and I helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> shape at a moment where I was desperately desperately <unk>
Occasionally the inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that conserving on my heart forever, while she's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes of tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and started a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, some day, who is trying to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way to me, that although I gave this violent ideology to this violent ideology, I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to talk against those acts of the actions of my father.
So with this simplicity I'm here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race or race -- that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.
This is a film that looks in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's 3D <unk> and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your starvation, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that project in front of your eyes.
And there's constantly a voice superimposed in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Every one of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, your own, you and you.
There is nothing to make us more directly.
At least I know I have a personal awareness.
I don't have sure that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not conscious of all, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why aren't we just robots that <unk> what we get to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to be a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, it's an objective of objective it.
<unk> by nature, is <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because during almost all the 20th century, we would take that vision.
psychology was studying <unk> behavior, neuroscience is studying the <unk> brain, but never no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw a little bit of this kind of work in the fantastic job that Nancy <unk> is a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
So I would like to explain that this kind of neuroscience of neuroscience answer answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness is about what they do in the brain of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the problems that are easy.
without offend the <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't tackles the real mystery of this <unk> why all of the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why does it have an internal <unk> film.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to become another phenomenon emerging as the <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find an explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how do you operate the <unk> how they are <unk> how they are <unk> and <unk> are <unk> living questions -- all questions about the target works.
That could be apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about, how we speak, how we play <unk> are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about the behavior are among the easy problems.
But the difficult problem, is the question of why it's all accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that will work. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we would get away at this point.
We have a wonderful theory, great. We get used to it, the physics explains chemistry, it explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to fit that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, it's kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our vision of the world, but we don't know yet how.
With a anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> mad, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, he's got one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such a difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and this is what everything needs an explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is useless.
But I go in a different direction.
In the long time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as fundamental <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic things.
On the contrary, they look fundamental and you build the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- <unk> mass laws -- so <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the power charge as a fundamental concept than those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, mass, load, then for logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be to look at consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it suddenly doesn't mean that it is all of a time.
It opens the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect to consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the weather, processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want these fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can do it in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everybody, <unk> for mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with heartbreak when you think -- "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> some early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anyone think that <unk>
This is part of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass and mass, to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest form and powerful laws of finding fundamental laws than we would think of thinking with the physical process, it's <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing, there are consciousness.
<unk> of Social <unk> like in a human, complex awareness.
<unk> simple information, simple consciousness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I mean <unk> has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a level of information integration of information, just quite significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, it particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of <unk> <unk>
It actually brings up a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality underlying the reality underlies it.
As Stephen Hawking's explains "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire at equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything that was consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think that thinking well, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk> film.
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information -- she has a complicated <unk> processing processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have very serious ethical problems about the development of development of intelligent computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the conscience of collective collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, as the audience in a TED Talk, we have a real collective consciousness, an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of each other <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer in the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing that consciousness is <unk> than the second thing that is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve the night in the morning.
But I think we finally will be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the wrong idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low profile of education.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, I was obsessed with younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to have a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an obvious problem.
She never had anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. How contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give you your <unk>
I said, "What do you think?
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in lawn chairs talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability as an inspiration.
And we don't -- and it's not the <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair of the wheels, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've been lied to the disability.
Yeah, have been sold to the lie that disability is <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not bad, and it doesn't make you remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more for this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one, the girl without his hands on a <unk> pencil with the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with <unk> legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the porn term <unk> because we would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we teach the disability in the benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, why is my life, it might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I have lost the account of the number of times that have been strange to say that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this would happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I got to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are given to people with disability in the benefit of people with no disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
So let's make some things.
But the things that we thrive are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I became called the social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disability because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
The things that I need to do, and I've learned to pull out the best of your ability as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies taking the best out of their ability.
So, it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think I am lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall away --  -- <unk> the ingenious, trick of how you can charge the battery cell phone on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that that lie that have been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stretch of stairs has never made it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen, I'm not going to appear to the <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom looking at <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considering anything for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people who are disability that we are <unk> to get out of the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 grade school is not a little amazed that his new teacher is a <unk> user player.
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about to know about it as it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to do is augmented reality and <unk> with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and on Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and happens because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing the Google <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that the Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you <unk> with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it is to run through the game field to 160 <unk> the <unk>
We can know that a man of 110 pounds were <unk> trying to <unk> it all of it.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
You know, some videos to show you what to use the Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> <unk> idea is a submarine going up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So, a little bit of a moment.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football camp -- from the perspective of <unk>
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of these, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> by <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is about a little bit more to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be your favorite players, and you have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk>
or from a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely a lot of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why by why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man on a roller coaster of his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with your arm before they run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of it.
When I can be able to be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball to the bottom of the network? Or <unk> by making it <unk>
What is your experience when you walk from a mountain to more than 100 an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it <unk> the <unk> <unk> for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. You give them money.
So, here's a quick review of technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> they put a <unk> to her <unk> in the field so that he would play faster.
They won Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a tiny plastic bombsight that you're in front of you, you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
You have to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How do you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is texting to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will have <unk> information.
This is going to make good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the analysis analysis of data will stop being just for nerds.
It will be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they're the field <unk>
You would take the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receptor. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your Norden bombsight -- you would tell you that an defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, but the system of <unk> <unk>
They went to the protection.
Another <unk> you get <unk> that there's an open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but you get paid.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we land, however, the receptor looks at its bombsight an area of grass that's lit up and you can modify the race.
He <unk> catching the <unk> running and <unk>
The <unk> audience and fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk> <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are, from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how to be <unk>
How much is it also for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids so that you think more in space and science rather than sticky notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, the challenges that we face, as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently joined by 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years, I spent the end of the United States -- the south end of the Lofa County -- which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Ocean Ocean and its <unk> architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most recent places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer the experimenter to build the bridge, said that "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped in their death from that bridge.
Some people think that traveling between the two towers that will take another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it frees you out of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one of four to five seconds, the body strikes against water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks all the bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of us die in impact.
The ones that don't normally lie in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this method of suicide will be aware of the death of the <unk> the death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to have before they have their life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the more dark, it's very difficult to bring you back.
I took this picture last year while this young man spoke with an officer looking at her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day in bringing it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> the suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists are trained to the new land.
This is Jason <unk>
I met this July July July of the past year when you get a call from a possible subject suicide subject at the bottom about the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an official Golden <unk> officer.
Jason was just 32 years old, and they had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, they had flown up here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could get more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
A few <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind of smart kid in New Jersey had just taken her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I suppose when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be a ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had it.
<unk> collateral damage affects a lot of people.
So I pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved a <unk>
What do you do?
Did you say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
You get to the front person in front of it can save the life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to <unk> hopelessness, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do to <unk> social isolation, and a losing interest in life.
And I came up with this talk about a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son at the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email for just a couple of days ago, and it's his permission and blessing that I read.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go up to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party to see the <unk> <unk>
It never came there.
I called the police police, and they would be <unk> like that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house, and reported me that the car of Mike was down the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been previously wrong without suffering from a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The Golden Golden Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I replied to a radio call for a possible subject suicide <unk> on the sidewalk near the north.
<unk> my bike. and I watched this man, Kevin <unk> foot on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, immediately the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the next time, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to go back on that lane and give the life another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> I got it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What did he do that <unk> and gave you the hope and life <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "I was <unk>
They stopped me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to give it to you.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase the <unk> events and you are one of the reasons that Kevin keeps with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness who has been properly <unk>
I was going to send Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- <unk> but thank God, we know that we know.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We thank God for you.
I miss debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of it she wrote, <unk> When I visited San Francisco General at night, you were going to go back like the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather would get <unk>
That act, even though they finished their own pain, the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who think of suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Normally this is accomplished by three things: and to sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved with hundreds of mental illnesses and calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved in -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other was a man who talked about about an hour.
So during that time, I was <unk> by hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few that have jumped from the bridge, and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that leaves the railing they realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us must be <unk>
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but you inside your inside you know what you are, and you ask yourself, how do you get in that?
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that he finally had a dream of a little girl.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth with my inner self.
For reasons why I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, I think, you get it out of it, you get it out of it.
But last October, I discovered that I'm just beginning.
We are all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some people have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my even <unk> agent I ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called revelation.
This is mine.
I recorded as a <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wear this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why do you always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to look at it.
The gender always has been considered <unk> but now we know that really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never got to share my story, not because I thought it will be what I'm bad, but why the world comes to those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being female.
I have mom, dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the African culture celebrating the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when he was still a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the head of a beauty of beauty pageant.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if you <unk> she was about the <unk> and the costume and the costume I won in a bathroom I won in <unk> and he got a third woman between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was from Queen of beauty of women <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when he <unk> to remote <unk> in the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. My mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he called me and I told me that I passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and he said, "You know if you give you the United States to you change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgery and safe surgery.
In that time in the U.S., it needed surgery before they changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their name of identity means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, to be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> lived in his truth, but he <unk> <unk> in order to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 of November we do a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and only me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here <unk> for some day no longer to be <unk> from 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  So thank you.  So thank you.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first, thank you with all my <unk>
And my parents of support, my parents think of my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the time I stayed with young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when I was called, and they told me that their parents couldn't take it, and I took the phone, he would call my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked out, it's just identity identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned to a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes this assignment is not a block -- and there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very gentle. <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> societies, and tribal parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who is referred to her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts <unk> in 2011, to the <unk> the National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It is not welcoming to his father, and his mother.
The neighborhood comes back to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother would become a lot about having a little girl.
When you give birth to the first child, the first daughter, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When she gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when she <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just a suffering, but the daughter <unk> daughter <unk> when it grows, it is too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it's left home and school for the siblings.
Up until the age of 12 years, somehow has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it was 13 years old, he was prohibit to go out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and her family, and if they were to put the code out of that honor, honor, that could even kill you.
And it's interesting that this <unk> code is not only affecting the lives of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of the honor.
And there's a norm more of the <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embracing the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't want.
If you <unk> it with a man who doesn't like or <unk> with an old man who has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the <unk> too young -- you have to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more sons and <unk>
And the irony is that this mother is that this mother <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
I got brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And a lot before I was thinking about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter so much.
But when I <unk> all of them were men, and I took my pen, and I got a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half, in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention this duty of a girl in a school?"
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies in tribal societies, it's a great event for life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
I applied to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when I went to the <unk> form and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I invite you to sit with me when my friends came to me.
<unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to <unk> in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys for the same.
I used education for <unk>
My daughters, teaching students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They took brothers and sisters, who are more rights for women and women to have more rights and more space for women in society.
But we were with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of engaging women in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and got up with the right to education.
He wrote a paper for the blog of the BBC, he was offered for the New York documentaries and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not stand for the campaign and the ninth 9 of 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I heard my wife -- "Should I hear me so I went to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't tell you."
<unk> the fair cause.
You take your life in play because of the cause, because of the peace of peace, and because of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were very much for me, and I didn't get asked again.
When I <unk> I was in the hospital, and I had severe headaches in my head, because his facial nerve was cut out, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to make it well. Please don't be <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
I got all the brothers and sisters, we've learned from it how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for children and women, it's like any 16 <unk>
<unk> when they didn't end their task.
You fight her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special in my <unk> that has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google group from Google, where I had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google visualization -- but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you hit a brain operation.
You're still just like smart or not?
Not to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide on the combinations and mix them out of chemicals, and try to make it to keep alive.
More than I have saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would be able to try to get the doses -- because it really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to test with <unk> and I was shocked to see how small changes in the dose will dramatically have my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months -- I tried dose and standard chemicals for a Japanese man, and I was surprised when I see my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they need to do -- since I get better with men.
What I was trying to do when I set up those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of reference to how I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today you have to challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works, and it is very simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I get to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> -- really sophisticated mental <unk> <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use their imagination only to lead to the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could get the music of your head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, like the way creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty in order to do this is simply increasing the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting this with two recent experiments that were done by two major groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image <unk> functional MRI to represent the brain. You can see the brain scanning by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left is the brain scan of a brain who looks at an image.
The <unk> column showing the brain scan of that same individual while they were going, watching that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the left column on the left of the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images -- always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the <unk> lab, in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube as they were <unk> their brains to create a large pool of brain reactions to video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images of new people, new animals, and as long as they get together a new <unk>
The computer just using the scanning brain information that scanning it to show you what seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us out.
We're right about doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember when you see an image, and when you can imagine that same image, it creates the same <unk>
This led to the world's <unk> systems that are available today, and its resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution for a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are lots of techniques to do that.
One is opening the skull and introducing electrodes.
I don't give you that one.
Many of you are proposing new techniques of projection to images -- even me -- <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we have to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, more <unk> magnets only offer little improvements in the resolution -- not increases by thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than large, let's make better magnets.
We can create structures that are much more complex with slightly different arrangements -- like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of money on MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and bright solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the others?
Instead, instead of a magnetic field -- you have to <unk> magnetic field patterns that are going to be <unk> by the frequencies of radio radius
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can get into a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid fluid, but the hormones and the hormones that I mentioned, and maybe even neural activity activity -- this is sleep.
We will be able to <unk> our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
Anyway, pick a year, pick up in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay side?
I think we all have <unk>
Her <unk> may be telling some person for the first time that he loves him or telling someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation for the one that you can put through in life.
So all I'm going to think is a very difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and getting out of that closet to be universal.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it should happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several phases of the <unk> <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope by the <unk> of my pants <unk> and I have <unk> my head -- I would usually ask myself a child -- "Hey, you're usually a kid or <unk>
And they would appear silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I would get it inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence -- but this time I was ready and I was about to enter the female issues at the table.   I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
On Gloria <unk> quotes from Gloria <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues" that we <unk>
And then I took it down the way down and I went down and went down and down my back, a four-year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a boy or <unk>
And then I took it back again again, and I said, "Hey, I know this is confusing.
I have the short hair like the guy in a boy, and I saw <unk> <unk> but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more than a girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas is <unk> and it has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. It's just sorry, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that we <unk>
It was the very difficult conversation for all I've ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how to be living in a closet.
It's like my <unk> it's not different from you or yours or yours.
So let me give you 100 reasons why to come out of my journey, it was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that you can explain to somebody who have declared online banking is harder than to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than telling your five-year-old who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing to do is just the difficult thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to make us feel better for someone else to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we should just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what the walls are made of your walls, a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years back.
I, who had a horse <unk> a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian who was struggling to fight any child in four who would go coffee.
I was frozen by the fear of fear, it was in a corner of my dark closet to me <unk> my gay, <unk> and moving only a muscle is the hardest thing that ever done.
My family, my full strange friends, with whom I've spent my entire life trying to try not to <unk> and now the world turned back to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was in my sister wedding.
It was the first time that many people in the guests knew that I was gay, and by making my <unk> and <unk> and I walked around the tables and I finally got to one where my parents were my parents, people I knew I was telling me about years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women interviewed <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
You were once in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us?
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but waiting for me desperately to show his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for somebody, but you can <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
That's how hard the hard conversations are still to be my strong point.
Ask anybody that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the <unk> <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of the way is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the other people must know that we also do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents maybe could be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate the truth.
It would never be bothered by that.
And some of them can go out safe, <unk> so they have done, but you never forget what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you're going to find on a dark closet <unk> <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And it may be very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> What is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has been seen -- an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that the question of if a machine can think is so interesting as the question of if a sub can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical issue for computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let me step up.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or the Earth of Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredibly large telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can observe the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept about intelligence on Earth, they would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some point in time, the asteroids that are going to give up the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be limited, adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, to the development of universal states that we will <unk> the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the robotic planning, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different themes and <unk> together, I said, for several years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a <unk> force, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain the open options with a force T, with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yes, even an imminent future time <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the options open.
And so having to realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
It will be the standard of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to better conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between the entropy and the intelligence is <unk> a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with the production of the long term, but that actually comes straight from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy.
<unk> <unk> could go through multiple animal intelligence, play games of humans, and even make money that we need to do it, and it would have been wrong with doing that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human, here we see <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and human care.
This tool of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity for cooperation has implications for economic development and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game <unk> against itself, <unk> his potential for play.
Here we look at <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where friends are constantly constantly connected to the network right now.
This same network capacity can also have applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering successfully using the Panama Canal to expand globally to the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable with problems in defense of creativity, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> they spontaneously find out and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiation that we successfully successfully increase the assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management will be broad applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of cognitive cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all of us derived from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk> here.
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you look at smart machines, there would be a rebellion <unk>
Machines will become against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion <unk> the reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart, and then they would try to take over the world.
It's all the other thing that the impulse to take control of all possible future is a fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
And they often ask me, "How do you look for goals of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence, or to help them understand the human intelligence or to help them understand the human intelligence -- is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the conquest of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
So especially in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how our Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which is that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the faint <unk> intensity of stars when the planets go in front of them, they blocking a little bit of that light that we do.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their stem star there.
And together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the ground planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get out of their own.
Instead, this gives clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds that are potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and sea ice ice that have been with us since we've been now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have very quickly <unk> our ability to disrupt its course.
But I am not a science scientist, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe, where to find life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested person in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I look for planets like Earth, more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown this by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and in part, that's why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> they track their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission, they take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now provide not just short space flights, but also the <unk> possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images -- they remind us of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas that are linked in our imagination with the ideas of <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place.
Let's take the extension of the areas of <unk> of our planet that are still going to be down in the way, places that are really related to Mars.
Even in the most dry places in the Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen oxygen by our forests in thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will take a big and sad <unk> of the implication and the belief that we have to expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
And so you like to like the exploration, I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to help humanity is to imagine that the captain of the Titanic is like to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will get place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration of exploration and law preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile areas and land in the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- <unk> <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked Fermi that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence for alien life so far.
Okay, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization colonization will save us from ourselves, but the ultimate preservation and the exploration, they can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to apply to the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the <unk> task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, <unk> my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window on the dining table in the dining table where there was <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed up.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least it had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I got my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but they sure not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, even though the circumstances, a good job is.
I'm a resident a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases heart rhythm, and the heart of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in his place, which would make bad things happen.
Or at least if bad things happen to be bad -- the likelihood that it is a total catastrophe in it.
So I started thinking about that, but until one month later, my thoughts were <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was a little embarrassed about the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed about my passport, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called <unk>
It's something that he learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> like <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, and then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
At the house, we put a place for the things that are very easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make the location of the important things, where the okay, where the fish are, where the fish are, the <unk> trees, where the tribes are and the <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes into the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that lets <unk> find their nuts.
And if somebody really asked if somebody actually did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> of the <unk> and even they could find their nuts.
They were not using smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that they move very much.
This is the reason for losing your car keys, reading and <unk>
So at home we put a place for keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer for you.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a picture of your credit card card license license, passport, <unk> for yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases up.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful <unk> situation that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to be loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talking about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the decision-making of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take out of a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and your cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of heart disease, heart attack, stroke brain.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you may have to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for that most doctors don't want to speak, and companies companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have surgery on any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And you have to think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor of the doctor, and if it's somebody else's fault is scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk> mechanisms.
But estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs works only from 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you can give someone a person?
300.
This is the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you should ask for a more statistical statistic and it is, <unk> of the effects. Okay?
For this particular drug, the side effects produce in five percent of the patients.
And those include things -- <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they're thinking, "The five percent is not so likely to happen to me, still taking the <unk>
But a moment.
You remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So think of how to do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 side of them, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
medical ethic is actually part of the informed consent of the first informed consent principle.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take your risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the older men in the age of 50, the number necessary for cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So that is, 49 surgeries per person who has <unk>
And the side effects of that case, are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice for many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things they talk about and think about now, with their family and loved ones.
You can change the view in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Happy face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very rapidly. You could get the lunch lunch -- so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that is going through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thinking, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown you.
So we have to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at time.
The idea is to think about the future how you might be those <unk> to put systems into the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent things wrong in the first place.
<unk> at the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate of the entrance to the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered -- and lots of messages that I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in your <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even smaller.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- I would never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the <unk> of a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the <unk> and over the time of time, it mixed with local signals, and the language we have now known as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that the sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world is like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk>
So how do I understand that?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people are <unk>
So I have learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't make a lot of noise from eating the bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, making sure <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, about what is going to come next.
So this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> for going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has come into my territory of art.
He's going to become more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And all they had taught me about the sound of the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could tell me.
I chose me to <unk>
There's a massive culture around the language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just like and become my voice.
That way I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in school, in the work and institutions, work with a lot of different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when I'm asking for <unk> your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I might be able to get in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with the sound like my new art culture, <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note -- you can't capture and completely express on paper.
And the same is true of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning both of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into a lot of different parameters in a lot.
If you take a different parameter for every finger while the piano hits the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the speed, the shape of hand, and so while the piano hits the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it was <unk> just one key at once.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in a way to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the name, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters that are able to express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and wears it.
This is all day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, you look like a piece of music.
All day day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how distance the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is getting closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, I would go back again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at the same time."
Look at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do this with me?
All of the hands on high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in my head like my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please get us again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work all.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all occur in the head and the chest. But they do very different meanings here.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> live and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have any sound -- it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allowing the <unk> to develop your own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> I don't have to hear about learning music.
The <unk> is a rich, and I'd like to have the same experience.
I would like to invite you to open his ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can give them everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance to say, because adults lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and they are not very good to clean up each other.
The time went on, now I'm adult and teach civil school and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, they're not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't get it."
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those little plastic pieces, to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and it's also very risky to use these enormous tools.
So along with my students, six to 15 years, we dream about making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work <unk> so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every child and try to figure out what we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids would become very much with the robots.
And then we created what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in prototype prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we took light bulbs and web cameras, and they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and by the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image, and measuring the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I would take this one step back into a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The great thing in this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I can investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very enlightened children.
So you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and they get stuck with this one.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using your hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked -- because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown -- the mud and the oil, are also brown color and when everything <unk> is very difficult to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all sorts of things that produce different <unk> which can help identify what there is in the water.
So let's take this prototype with a sensor, and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I can investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe addressing a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> various cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant to Fukushima, a nuclear fraction of the water.
And today, according to the reports of a 300 metric tons still are leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, is very safe -- it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year since the crash and researching independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to get the kids.
Of course, not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we got to the center of <unk> here you see the use of <unk>
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the <unk> data, that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we create a <unk> <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map, <unk> map to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this, we could notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the nearest to the nuclear central to date.
We approaching a mile of nuclear <unk> and with the fishermen help from the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> device as we invented and we've built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small hence, we find an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we become the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with energy energy.
For example.
Or, we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheelchair chairs in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are our lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizen scientists, creators, <unk> we must prepare the next generation to be worried about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically <unk>
One is made from thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one of a single silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One puts it on the environment, the other one.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> marble saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, the cells, we have all the information that was required by every cell for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made out of place, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think about their objects as <unk> of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores together.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts mostly as filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here's a split screen which represents my vision of the world -- the <unk> of every designer and architect to work in the work between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and synthesis, is shown in the two screens behind me.
My work, in its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, flying from the assembly and coming up to growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why couldn't this do 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a very rare moment, where four disciplines are offering access to access to tools that we had never had access before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools to scale and tools to scale through scale, as this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters of diameter that someday not very far print <unk> buildings, and graphics at the nanoscale made from genetically engineered -- genetically engineered that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture -- and it has created a screen where every aperture is <unk> to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a fashion fashion fashion of Paris with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing collaborator <unk> we print this layer and <unk> 3D skirt between the cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this highly <unk> analytical <unk> that allows them to design products that <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a <unk> <unk> and they also absorb sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator went back to nature for <unk> and when we design this <unk> surface becomes <unk>
It took this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not using the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> material property.
But it's <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a young Jewish home -- but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God send the Earth to grow a <unk> tree, <unk> tree.
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, and as leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land did grow trees with twigs, cortex, dry and flowers.
The earth created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design look like if the objects were <unk>
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we looked at the <unk> material, the kind of tree <unk> with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons is produced every year by organisms like shrimp, and crabs, and <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune into your properties, we could generate structures that are <unk> in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We asked a bunch of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk> <unk>
We prescribe chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties from dark, very hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print structures on a large scale, it built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could actually vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of one kind of <unk> material, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, the dry leaves in order to find a natural form of contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> which arose for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture carbon in the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition from <unk> problems and <unk> and <unk> even more, window.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure of shrimp husks on an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best two: for objects that are designed for <unk> jobs, <unk> life and placed in the ground, will help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life to <unk>
To do that, we need to master the bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> table, we did our own <unk> new forms of life that are created by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological infrastructure inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these invisible <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the <unk> <unk>
And the second one, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, you will never meet.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
To hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the tract tract <unk> that will help us <unk> these bacteria and to make it <unk> their way.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, and we would take the properties of material according to the functionality in the road.
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> more transparent channels.
This digestive system is <unk> when it stretch from one end to another one, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "Are we <unk> <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, <unk> the skeletal tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing the biology.
I call it the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer prints material <unk>
You also know that nature does not make it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This caterpillar from <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home inside which is <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, by putting those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm is first on the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors -- and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the worm silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm on a plane, not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a flat, <unk> and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different across different environments, and we've discovered that the way, the <unk> the structure of the <unk> was transmitted directly by the environment.
Often it <unk> silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape <unk> <unk> a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we got this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing silk, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk areas towards the darkest areas and <unk> so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, get the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get to the <unk>
We asked <unk> <unk> -- silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> you get this whole pavilion out of it.
And just over two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry that this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> is through a robotic arm, the other fills empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products to the products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions in the world.
What it takes us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new age of creation, that leads to a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by the design that requires us, for the first time, that we make for nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked you what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused it some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school, I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and studied websites and I also played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And in general, I like to try and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I'm going to focus on the other thing, something completely different, and I was excited about it, and I let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions, and I would say to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of commitment, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> they learned from the culture.
You ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they did at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
You put the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is about again and again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are going to pick you up in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be about <unk>
It happens to be the nice exercise of before what the dream. occurs.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream what might be, not inspired by everything you might be.
In fact, it does just the other thing, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults well <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to do with for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and to spend your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that show their curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel that there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if you divide it into three <unk> a potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You have any term you like or you might like it or your own.
It seems like a kind of fit to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers ...
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in <unk>
Rachel <unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests shared in cartography, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
Rachel and Rachel came up with this idea of this unique idea for its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
And that's the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, you can get to a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is the rapid learning.
When we <unk> we are <unk> by something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for having been many times in the past, and this means we have less afraid to try new things and go out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> at full time and <unk>
As a little girl was an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it became a writer, he was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when it was starting their address, and this ability helps to write the <unk> of the editors.
I rarely have a loss of time to be involved in what you would give you to do, even if you finally get it out.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, a way that you might not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. It means the ability to transform in whatever you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other websites, sometimes consultant to Kickstarter, sometimes a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, it's James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
Science Magazine Company defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market, the ones that actually <unk>
We need to take care of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to themselves.
We have complex problems -- <unk> right now, and we need creative creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, on your heart, <unk>
I read the belly because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep in depth and put in practice, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all be able to design lives and careers that are going to be connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in large part of them are told to be more like their <unk>
Once I said that, if there's one thing you take out of this talk, I hope that's this: <unk> with your internal wiring whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist then, then you go through the media.
That's where you will give the best thing.
But for <unk> in the room, including those who just noticed being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
Take the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we had a woman named <unk> they brought it to a psychiatric mental <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but they were going to go through it until she was unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange plates and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy that had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you were to have been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than he <unk> gave him a years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call disease disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But little has moved on to Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about it all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it's going to affect 150 million that, by the way, include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each other.
In other words, there's the likelihood that you spend their years with Alzheimer's disease or helping care for a friend or dear disease.
It's already in America, health care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One in five dollars of healthcare spends in disease disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs, a <unk> increase in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively short for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one who can't be able to cure or cure or even slow down.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that disease costs us more and cause a year of deaths from deaths as cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but the whole world. Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us even, scientists, confused Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to replacing severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by reducing significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strange <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> points end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots get on the outside.
This makes protein molecules beating each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step is complex, like a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we can do it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of them have reduced wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical, physical, engineers, physical <unk>
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. We're now testing a new kind of drugs that are blocking specifically this way to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos from what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These maggots, the maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that they stick in each other, like in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that they <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive results, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, from overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move forward on HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden, caregivers of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking to them, and they help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I <unk> this article in the New York Times column, in January of this year.
To love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience, when we test it a night in the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to be 36 and smaller questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you hit someone else's <unk>
And <unk>
<unk> that are <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number one: <unk> really reminds me to your partner what you like from him or her, I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to somebody you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a big detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we got <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the baby neocortical column, a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I suppose some of you probably wonder, they go together.
And the reason I think you challenge this is because you've asked me this question over and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the article was published was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my friends from Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand noticed.
And that came a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as a result, I had no idea.
The article came online at night at night, and already Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And the Sunday had been called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million <unk> and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with each other, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or I wrote what they did every day for weeks, always, the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox with my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I actually gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the response.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> your own life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article called <unk> which included the experiences of the readers when we test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
We have TV interviews, and I would tell you the orders for two of us two.
I think I was afraid to become a afraid of becoming the Tunisian icons of the <unk> process, a range of which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if I was really able to produce <unk> love, not only an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, mostly that people published the wrong question.
How do you know if we go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, it would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there was the goal of researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for to sought to interpersonal approach, among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt closer after doing -- several later studies, they also used the protocol <unk> <unk> <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they've used it between people from the opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact -- it was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you get away from the person with whom you do it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> I know they managed to get better to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation of it.
I had had this relationship since I had 20, which I was supposed to practically all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I pushed in the science.
I was able to do everything I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that to sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought only for the book that I was writing for, but in retrospect, it looks really like <unk>
I thought that if I was excited about the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to just like I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what I am.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably you can demand me.
So what I'm looking for for the love is an assurance -- not only to be <unk> today, and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> on the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut for <unk>
There may be a way for some ways to mitigate something of the risk -- and this is a very <unk> story, because in love in love with a beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that asks, "Well, still together?
And his content with an answer.
So more than a question, let's ask you questions more difficult, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How are you going to stay in love when things <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But love in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> in love -- because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was no anything that was supposed to be.
I didn't think how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how much it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and go, 36 questions, I've chosen to love somebody so generous, and kind of fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe really.
And what we're going to do, and what maybe I'm going to spend my life looking for this is that that myth is true.
I want the very happy ending to implicit in my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love loving somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian <unk> and in a way I got a <unk> of the forest.
And in New York City a time.  One thing that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, a dollar, and a <unk> and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would be, and for example how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it's <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like going to ride and <unk> and all of those <unk> things, and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the <unk> of resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother has a fear of bees and it is <unk> them, so I added more resins on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it occurred to the opposite: somehow it seemed to come up with size, as if it was <unk> text with a <unk>
So I did I build more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs strange bottles that would find out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> draw just like a dead <unk> in the crime scene.
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, you will be able to get an idea.
Then I made some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning a little bit of money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk> me.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to a window in a window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that make these three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- that I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 kilos.
5.5 feet long.
It has double expensive, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
You're from the <unk> of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
So here is where creatures with animals are running the <unk> smart <unk> for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a God tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin Laden, are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
And also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while the other hand comes out.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a look at <unk>
It's a little bit of history.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and spitting clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> tail, a snake tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things I go by, you know.
Their tail ends up in a <unk> eye balloon made of 1986.
They have <unk> them.
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> for your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
It's like cells, they come together, they come together.
And you can walk between them. It's bringing me out.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human <unk>
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, the entrance can <unk>
I'm going to play for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that covers the penis or a <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a match in half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and coming into the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> angle.
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a a painter, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a <unk> a museum, a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people in it hits each other with each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get older, who is and the box that it's living on.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made from the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with success, and we are all going to die in very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill actually has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug will lead into the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs -- these are <unk> to reduce the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known for their side effects on its most negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the current stream, it gets worse and worse than the time it takes to reach its destiny, which is where it's more important in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like the nodes -- the <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily in the blood bloodstream.
However, after the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new bacterial cells.
This is the great issue of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life that is a living treatment for life.
And one day, I sat down and I thought, "Let's get the treatment directly to the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery surgery for diabetes, they can be used for anything else, including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're using a laser <unk> to open or drill extremely small holes, and they open and close and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of a laser beam of laser <unk> on the infected cell membrane while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser passes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug on a matter of microseconds.
Before you even noticed the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're now testing this in vitro technology or in Petri plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, We'll do a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it runs to the place of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser uses again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look very much about it.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all of the <unk> researcher in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups -- not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to the confrontation of violent <unk>
I do work in the field of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve almost all of the conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed up between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we must even have <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but nobody is looking at what they do when they don't get to.
The armed struggle and the policies are not armed <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide suicide attacks, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking again.
It <unk> a complex communication machinery stations of radio, TV channels, online web websites and social networks.
And here they have the printed magazine magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising <unk> but by using business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to try better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else, create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they manage hospitals, they run professional training training programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state won't be safe and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan ripped around the war, or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> you can also see the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a <unk> price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means to fill a empty gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to understand the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps in the government, and they emerge as armed and political and political groups, involved in violent struggle and providing governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated things are these organizations, we can use it as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They put part of a territory running all its functions, they collect the trash, they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, from nations without state and hybrids and the weakest of them are the states, as in the Middle East today, more <unk> and <unk> that gap of government actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in <unk> tools.
And they would take that government of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put it into peace.
If we understand better groups -- we'll understand better what incentives offer to foster violence from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors don't <unk> military power can win some battle, but we don't give us peace and stability.
To get these goals in the long term we need to fill that safe long-term investments to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to embrace the label of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I got a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke was meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take one step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> the sex. Like if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and the anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that could be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a very unpleasant word.
I was struck by a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which calls too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in a <unk> <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They do the same wages for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world like <unk> or violence.
We have the right to use a easy way and accessible to your contraceptives and services for them.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to figure out our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and bringing social condition, and skills and so much more.
We need to have to realize these differences and how we get ourselves in the same way that it matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession:
When I lead to work, listen to rap music to just volume.
Although the letter spreads to women and offends me, deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of yin yang it's amazing.
You actually have your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you hit the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am totally <unk> by musical personality.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the things I don't want to do --  -- all the things I don't want to do, but also kill insects, the garbage collection and <unk> and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion journals and <unk> things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories that make reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it is her choice, and I am not a <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they were going to.
So let's take this problem.
<unk> the conventional Feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, business workers, gay men and <unk> for white, white class <unk>
Listen, if that's good Feminism I'm a very bad feminist <unk>
It also happens to be this: <unk> a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put blogging <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we will make perfect play.
When we get away the <unk> with a lot of love from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to be <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> fear of what that <unk> means that <unk> for fear can't be able to fulfill the <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like I call you, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> in front of the word <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star from <unk> embracing openly Feminism and to know women and young men who become feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time -- the cultural critics started endless debates that if they were <unk> it was or not just feminist.
They would be able to, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk>
<unk> perfection is because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We go far beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to make sure of any of any woman, <unk> <unk> until it's not left.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive Feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happened?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little more courageous <unk>
If I hear music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to give you a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify the worst choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
These are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and very brave. I want to grow in a world.
And so where they were told, because of the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best way to do it as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to the sex violence against women as a sport, of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we listen to songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his journal participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't involve a number of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to try to participate in this kind of projects, we can also be able to be able to be more than more like ourselves as far as we get to overcome the barriers to the standards.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements is going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions come to the top, people in power and movie producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, and more courageous, to create a lasting lasting change.
We can also say with bravery of our feminism, good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> going to be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I mean, most of all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it the incident to deal with what happened.
A couple of kids came up with me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated like it was nothing.
I started to believe it was nothing.
It <unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't want to believe I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was struck by a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, also discovered that if I was a little parent, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the fact that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad C? I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little courageous, when you need to be a little bit of a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, had been <unk> for having visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then across the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with an immune immune system is one of the most unlikely disease in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but a lot of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> the autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that broke the argument about autism and the vaccines of <unk> <unk> and marked by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines are in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians that I'd heard about it creates their whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence remained only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> they refer to being routinely the autism as an epidemic, as if I could get another child in <unk>
What's going on here?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people the Center for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and "a better detection detection to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young woman who seeks in the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the criteria of diagnosis had to be <unk> why were they so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> from the science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told the story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private, <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours waving their hands before their faces, but they were prey of panic as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as a major authority of the world on the subject, declared less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as we were making references of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, we can give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
It was once <unk> that he had become nine from every 10 children sent up for other doctors to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have been very carefully at a refrigerator that didn't go away.
At the same time, however, <unk> noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I hit the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite disks he said, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the kids were just simply <unk> what they had heard their parents -- they were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became the source of shame for the families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, turning into invisible to the world in general.
Now, amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive science psychologist thought that the theory of mothers who were <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was John <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl as it was Susie!
To defend the National <unk> of Health <unk> that they needed more resources for autistic kids, and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They ran a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
I took a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse and diverse <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
So these kids didn't fit these kids in <unk> and <unk> like <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model, would be predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realize these children before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the <unk> item and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he was German, and he would take it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in your clinic started with music, and the kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> forms of support and spaces in the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of methods that were especially suited to them.
The Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common and they always have been, looking at aspects of this continuum known in <unk> culture as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even though to say that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silently with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of what they called the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, changes in <unk> by replacing the limited model of <unk> by a wide and <unk> model.
These changes didn't fell on <unk> broken off.
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, <unk> and parents from everybody knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to make a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnostics began to <unk> like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that it went, so what they do with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that they <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the rise of <unk> a simple, <unk> and <unk> story as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of preventing preventing one in 68 children are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, people have people joined on the Internet to reject the idea that puzzles are going to be solved by the new medical breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate varieties of human cognition.
A way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC is not working, it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily easily <unk> social <unk> and they are having a attention deficit to details.
<unk> people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities, communities, communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we go back to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
